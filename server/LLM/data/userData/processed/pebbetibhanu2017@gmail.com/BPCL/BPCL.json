Our refinery operations were optimized, and we strategically diversified our crude oil sources to reduce the adverse impact of global price volatility in crude oil. These proactive actions made it possible for us to tide over the seemingly unsurmountable challenge, and enabled us to maintain seamless availability of fuel and petroleum products for the nation.\nIndia has emerged as a powerhouse of global economic growth and is witnessing a \nrising energy demand. We are making large commensurate investments to fuel this growth momentum.\nWalking on the path of an ambitious energy transition, we have crafted a blueprint \nfor a more resilient and efficient core business and to build a substantial portfolio of sustainable energy. We are leading this change by leveraging innovation and cutting-edge technology to step up our multi-pronged efforts in this direction. \nWe are tapping into the profound synergies of integrating refinery and petrochemical \noperations. We are also helping in the unfolding of an era of sustainable transportation, which is one of the key pillars of climate action. And our rural push in consumer retailing is kindling tantalizing entrepreneurial possibilities for women folk in the hinterland of the nation. \nIndia is a hotbed of new-age entrepreneurship, and ambitious young Indians are \neager to make their presence felt nationally and globally. Acting as a catalyst to lead this change, we are nurturing and guiding promising startups to enable them to reach their full potential. \nWe are captivated by the faith and allegiance of our customers, which is a reflection of our \nsteadfast dedication to constantly delight them with novel and enhanced experiences. \nT oday\u2019s world is characterized by the speed of change, and we are snapping up \nopportunities and turning them to our advantage through agility and prudence.

Even as we navigate a challenging business \nenvironment, our focus continues to be professionalism and good governance in all aspects of our business. This is reflected in the excellent operational performance by all \nbusiness units during the year and the sharp turnaround \nin the financial results in the latter part of the year, after being severely impacted by global headwinds in the first half of FY 2022-23.\nThe domestic economy\u2019s resilience through the crisis of a \nonce-in-a-century pandemic followed by the geopolitical \ncrisis has been remarkable. While most of the major economies continue to grapple with fiscal challenges, India has been an oasis of growth and stability. India was second biggest contributor to world growth in 2022. \nOur economy grew at 7.2% in FY 2022-23, and the \ndomestic consumption of petroleum products grew at \n10.6%. You will be pleased to know that your company recorded the highest-ever market sales of 48.92 MMT in the year, as against 42.51 MMT in the comparative period, registering a growth of 15%. With a market share of 25%, we retained our position as the second-largest Oil Marketing Company during the year. Our refineries \nsupported the marketing efforts by recording the highest-\never throughput of 38.53 MMT in FY 2022-23, at a capacity utilization of 109%. \nOur revenue from operations rose to all-time high of ` 5.3 \ntrillion as against `4.3 trillion in the previous year, making \nus the sixth-largest company across all categories in the \ncountry by turnover. BPCL\u2019s colors shine brightest when it meets challenges head on. In this challenging year which was marred by suppressed marketing margins on certain petroleum products, our robust refineries achieved their all-time high Gross Refining Margins (GRMs) at $20.24/\nbbl, highest amongst the PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The year\u2019s financial performance was volatile with two-\nquarters of losses, but these were put behind with a \nrecord-breaking performance in the fourth quarter, with standalone profit rising 159% year-on-year and 231% \nquarter-on-quarter to ` 64.78 billion. For the year as \na whole, the company posted a standalone net profit \nof `18.70 billion as compared to the restated profit of \n`113.63 billion in FY 2021-22.\nIndia is increasingly assuming a leadership role in the comity of nations. The country\u2019s democratic fabric, consistent economic growth and focus on sustainability \nare receiving acclaim globally. Having become the 5\nth \nlargest economy in the world, the country is well on \ncourse to becoming a $10 trillion economy by 2035. As \nthe industrialization and urbanization in India gathers\n\nAnnual Report 2022-233\npace in the coming years, the overall energy demand \nwill keep increasing in the foreseeable future. There is \npotential for India\u2019s share of global oil demand to rise \nto 11% in the coming years from around 5% currently. \nA burgeoning middle class will be looking for innovative \nsolutions for their energy requirements. India's ambitious goal of attaining net-zero emissions by 2070, combined \nwith its strong determination to become Aatmanirbhar \nin energy by 2047, is set to accelerate the adoption of \ncleaner and more efficient energy solutions. This opens \nup significant economic opportunities for the companies operating in the energy sector.\nWith the existing diverse portfolio of products and \nservices, and our strategic aspirations centered on the \nprinciples of Nurturing the Core \u2013 refining, upstream and \nmarketing of petroleum products; and Investing in future \nbig bets \u2013 petrochemicals, gas, non-fuel, green energy and digital, the company is well positioned to play a critical role in the energy landscape of India and to increase its \nglobal footprints. The strategy aligns with the company\u2019s \nplan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 in Scope 1 and Scope 2. These aspirations, with a planned capex outlay of around ` 1.5 lakh crore in the next five years, will \nenable us to create long-term value for our stakeholders \nwhile preserving our planet for future generations. \nThe merger of Bharat Oman Refineries Limited (BORL) \nwith BPCL, executed flawlessly this year, has not only bolstered our core refining and marketing businesses but \nalso laid a robust foundation for our ambitious ventures \nin the petrochemical industry. \nI am delighted to share the wonderful news of our \nrecent finalization of the Ethylene Cracker Project at Bina. With a staggering investment of ` 490 billion, this \nproject marks a historic milestone as the largest single investment in BPCL's illustrious history. The project also involves brownfield expansion of the Bina refinery capacity from 7.8 MMTPA to 11 MMTPA, to primarily cater to the feed requirements of petrochemical plants.  \nThis project will drive the production of essential \npetrochemicals, increasing the share of petrochemicals \nin the company\u2019s product portfolio to about 8%. This \ninvestment fits well with the government\u2019s mission to make India a self-reliant and globally competitive \npetrochemical manufacturing hub.\nThe disruptions in the global energy supply chain and \nthe soaring oil prices have brought the issue of supply security to the fore - not just for your company but for the \ncountry as well. The Company will continue its focus and efforts on the upstream Oil & Gas projects, particularly to \nenable earliest monetization of the discoveries made in \nMozambique and Brazil. The initial 2-Train LNG Project in Area 1, Mozambique which is the first step towards  \nunlocking the world-class gas resources of approximately \n63 Trillion Cubic Feet in which BPCL holds 10% stake, is \npoised to resume operations in the latter part of 2023. We \nare confident that this will propel us to new heights on the energy frontier.\nDuring the year, the Company strategically fortified its gas \nportfolio by seamlessly integrating Bharat Gas Resources Limited (BGRL) through the merger. We are steadfastly \nworking towards development of the City Gas Distribution \nnetwork with a capital outlay of over ` 375 billion.  \nTo strengthen the supply chain and streamline the distribution of essential petroleum products, the Company is investing around ` 27.53 billion in Petroleum \nOil Lubricants and Lube Oil Base Stock installations at Rasayani in Maharashtra and product pipeline from its Mumbai Refinery to Rasayani. \nI am happy to share that we are investing almost ` 10 \nbillion to set up two 50MW captive wind power plants \nin Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to support our \nrefineries in Mumbai and Bina. Feasibility studies are in progress for additional energy projects in wind and solar.\n\nin Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to support our \nrefineries in Mumbai and Bina. Feasibility studies are in progress for additional energy projects in wind and solar. \nAligning with the government\u2019s efforts towards boosting \nGreen Hydrogen capacity, we are also setting up a Green Hydrogen Plant at Bina Refinery to meet the hydrogen \nrequirements of the refinery.  \nSignificant initiatives are being taken on the sustainable \nmobility front. We have launched an initiative to offer \nelectric vehicle charging stations at around 7,000 energy \nstations over the next five years to support and accelerate \ngrowth of electric vehicles (EV) in the country. Several \nhighways have already been covered under our Fast-\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited4\nCharging EV Corridors. We are actively working on \nSustainable Aviation Fuel. Having achieved 10.6% ethanol blending in petrol in this year, we plan to increase the \nblending to 12% in the FY 2023-24 and endeavor to reach \n20% blending by 2025. To support this initiative and to ensure availability of ethanol across the country, the \ncompany more than doubled its Ethanol storage capacity to 112 TKL in the last financial year. We have started selling biodiesel-blended diesel, and the ratio of blending is bound to go up in the coming months. Sale of Compressed Bio-Gas was commenced from 41 retail outlets, and over 300 \nLetters of Intent were issued for a total production of over \n5 lakh TPA of Compressed Bio-Gas.\nYour company has been on a massive digital transformation \nexercise over the last few years. Digitisation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are being adopted across the company\u2019s activities, from refinery operations to supply-chain management to receiving and processing orders from retail and industrial customers. End-\nconsumers are getting the best customer experience \nacross all touch points through the \u2018Hello BPCL\u2019 platform, which now has more than 3 million registered users and a footprint of 100,000 customers per day. Our UPI-based solution, Ufill, has also found good traction. The Corporation endeavors to integrate more operations and \nservices through technological solutions.  \nHuman Resource is the most important asset of this \norganization. With the largest young work force in the world, India is a breeding ground for bright and enthusiastic minds. Identifying resources capable of adapting to new technologies, assisting them in filling skill gaps and grooming them to becoming good leaders is a priority of BPCL. The combination of a technically sound \nwork force with an ability to adapt to modern technology \nwill yield rich dividends to the company. Demonstrating true care for the welfare of our workforce is firmly embedded in the value system of the organization.  \nFostering a healthy climate for entrepreneurship by \nsupporting startups has been another contribution by \nBPCL to unearth and channelize inherent talents.    BPCL is committed towards upliftment of society and the \nunderprivileged. Our  thrust areas for social development \nare education, skill development, water conservation and \ncommunity development, and healthcare. \nDear shareholders, the current financial year will \nbe equally challenging, as the external environment remains dynamic with the reshaping of the world order. \nIt will be interesting to observe how production cuts by some OPEC+ members and the expected slowdown in \nadvanced economies counteract each other. Yet, each \nchallenge offers an opportunity to innovate and evolve. As \ndemonstrated in the last financial year, we will continue \nto be agile, putting customers and people at the center \nof our actions. Ensuring safe and reliable operations will \nalways remain paramount in all our actions. \nI would like to thank the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural \nGas for their unflinching support and guidance in all our \nactivities. I am thankful to my colleagues on Board of \nDirectors for providing astute leadership to the organization.  I would like to take the opportunity to thank various State \nGovernments, our channel partners, customers, vendors, bankers and our employees for their sustained support \nthat has been instrumental in BPCL having another very \nsuccessful year. To all our shareholders, thank you for the \nfaith you have placed in BPCL.\nI would like to end with a quote \u201cBe the change that you \nwish to see in the world\u201d. We have envisioned a much \nbigger and much brighter tomorrow and I assure you that \nwe will be the change catalyst in our collective effort to \nrealize our aspirations.\nKrishnakumar Gopalan  \nChairman & Managing Director\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23 5BoarD of DireCtors\nKRISHNAKUMAR GOPALAN\nChairman & Managing Director\n(w.e.f. 17.03.2023)\nARUN KUMAR SINGH\nChairman & Managing Director \n(up to 31.10.2022)\nAdditional charge as Director (Marketing) \n(up to 21.08.2022)\nVETSA RAMAKRISHNA GUPTA\nDirector (Finance)\nAdditional charge as Chairman & Managing Director \n(from 01.11.2022 up to 17.03.2023), Additional charge \nas Director (Human Resources) (up to 30.04.2023)\nSANJAY KHANNA\nDirector (Refineries)\nSUKHMAL KUMAR JAIN\nDirector (Marketing) \n(w.e.f. 22.08.2022)\nRAJKUMAR DUBEY\nDirector (Human Resources)\n(w.e.f. 01.05.2023)\nKAMINI CHAUHAN RATAN\nAS&FA,  MoP&NG \n(w.e.f. 21.12.2022)\nYATINDER PRASAD\nJS&FA, MoP&NG \n(w.e.f. 29.10.2022 up to 19.12.2022)\nGUDEY SRINIVAS\nAS&FA, Ministry of Consumer Affairs & Food \n& Public Distribution, Financial Adviser, \nMOP&NG (up to 25.09.2022)\nSUMAN BILLA\nPrincipal Secretary, \n(Industries & NORKA) \nGovernment of Kerala\nHARSHADKUMAR P .

This difficult context highlights a \nmultitude of challenges. \nThe global economic trends have been mixed, reflecting \nboth improved conditions and persisting downside \nrisks, largely centering on inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. The actions taken in the recent past by the policymakers are likely to play a significant role in the pace and course of the world\u2019s economic recovery.\nGLobAL ecoNomYIn the fiscal year 2022-23, policymakers faced a \nparadoxical challenge of managing inflation while simultaneously supporting economic growth. During \nthe first half of the year, global economic activity was \nexperiencing a broad-based and sharper-than-expected slowdown, with inflation higher than that seen in several decades. \nGlobal inflation surged to 8.7% from 4.7% in 2021, \novershooting targets in most countries throughout the year. Central banks have contended that near-term growth sacrifice would be needed to bring down inflation to protect the long-term prospects for growth. This surge in inflation triggered successive interest rate hikes by central banks, thereby pulling back liquidity from the system, which eventually marred the growth outlook. \nAs per the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global \nGDP growth rate experienced a slowdown, declining from 6.0% in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022. Furthermore, it is projected to drop to 2.8% in 2023. Advanced economies are expected to see slower growth in near future, with a \nforecast of below 1.3% in 2023 compared to 2.7% in 2022.\nHowever, recent high-frequency indicators suggest that \nthe momentum of global growth is sustained in the second quarter of 2023. The global composite Purchasing \nManagers\u2019 Index (PMIs) rose to an 18-month high in May \n2023, powered by the services sector. The US economy is slowing but at a gradual pace, with jobs growth and wage \nlevels holding despite successive hikes in interest rates \nby the Federal Reserve since March 2022. Global inflation is easing, but slowly. Some commodity prices have \ndeclined amidst the easing of supply chain pressures. \nGlobal food prices have also fallen to their lowest levels \nin two years, with declines in grains, vegetable oil and \ndairy prices.  \nGlobal trade remains a challenge and has taken a hit due \nto rising protectionism in several countries. There has been a realignment of global supply chains due to the war in Ukraine and fragmentation in finance and technology \nflows. Foreign Direct Investment flows have slowed. \nVarious projections show that while services exports will be high, export of manufactured goods is likely to be on the lower side.\nWith monetary policy focused on moderating inflation \nwhile stabilizing financial markets, fiscal policy is left as \nthe potential tool to boost economic growth. With public \ndebt at historically elevated levels, there is less room for expansionary fiscal policy. However, receding of the dislocations created by the Russian-Ukraine war, easing \npressure on global supply chain, decline in shipping \ncosts and the opening up of China after the prolonged COVID restrictions offer a semblance of positivity to the global economy.\nIndia & World GDP Growth %Percentage\nUSD trillion\n (8.00) (6.00) (4.00) (2.00) -  2.00  4.00  6.00  8.00  10.00 \n -  0.50  1.00  1.50  2.00  2.50  3.00  3.50  4.00 India & World GDP Growth %\nIndia GDP  : GDP (current USD trillion) World IndiaPercentage\nUSD trillion\nApr-22\nMay-22\nJun-22\nJul-22\nAug-22\nSep-22\nOct-22\nNov-22\nDec-22\nJan-23\nFeb-23\nMar-23\nApr-230510CPI Inflation (2012 Base)\n  \n  \n  \nMonthly CPI Inflation (2012 Base) RBI Tolerance Band\nApr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun626772778287INR v/s USD\n\nFeb-23\nMar-23\nApr-230510CPI Inflation (2012 Base)\n  \n  \n  \nMonthly CPI Inflation (2012 Base) RBI Tolerance Band\nApr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun626772778287INR v/s USD\n2022-23 2021-22 2020-211980\n1982\n1984\n198619881990\n1992\n199419961998\n2000\n20022004\n2006\n20082010\n2012\n2014201620182020\n2022 (8.00) (6.00) (4.00) (2.00) -  2.00  4.00  6.00  8.00  10.00 \n -  0.50  1.00  1.50  2.00  2.50  3.00  3.50  4.00 India & World GDP Growth %\nIndia GDP  : GDP (current USD trillion) World IndiaPercentage\nUSD trillion\nApr-22\nMay-22\nJun-22\nJul-22\nAug-22\nSep-22\nOct-22\nNov-22\nDec-22\nJan-23\nFeb-23\nMar-23\nApr-230510CPI Inflation (2012 Base)\n  \n  \n  \nMonthly CPI Inflation (2012 Base) RBI Tolerance Band\nApr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun626772778287INR v/s USD\n2022-23 2021-22 2020-21\n\nAnnual Report 2022-2359\niNDiAN ecoNomY\nAmid the global uncertainties, India\u2019s economy has \nbeen an outperformer, reflecting robust domestic consumption and lesser dependence on global demand. The Indian economy is cautiously shining and the growth moderation for India in the financial year 2022-23 is premised on an ongoing global economic slowdown, tight monetary conditions, and elevated oil prices.\nAs per the National Statistical Office\u2019s provisional \nestimates released on May 31, 2023, the Indian economy grew 7.2% in 2022-23, up from 7.0% estimated earlier. The GDP growth for the year exceeded the estimate due to strong growth in the last quarter of the year. GDP grew 6.1% in the January-March quarter, up from 4.5% in the October-December quarter. The GDP growth was 9.1% in 2021-22, supported by a favourable base effect due to low growth in the pandemic year. \nAmong the broad sectors in the economy, the services \nsector continued to rebound, driving growth during the year. Services sector grew 9.3% in 2022-23, much more than the growth in agriculture and industry combined. The government\u2019s thrust on infrastructure has also helped boost growth. In the year 2022-23, the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), a crucial measure of investments in the economy, demonstrated significant growth, increasing by 11.4%. The growth was primarily driven by increased construction activity, which, in turn, positively impacted key indicators like steel consumption, cement production, and imports of capital goods. \nIndia also experienced a surge in inflation during 2022-\n23, mainly due to global supply shocks and high input costs. The sharp rise in international crude oil prices, food, fertilisers and metals exerted broad-based price pressures during the year. As a result, Consumer Price Index inflation reached a peak of 7.8% in April 2022. Inflation moderated after the gradual normalisation of global supply chains, softening of global commodity prices, government supply management measures and monetary tightening by the Reserve Bank of India. Overall, inflation rose to 6.7% in 2022-23 from 5.5% in 2021-22.The Indian Rupee declined by 8.5% against the US dollar over the last fiscal. This depreciation, rather than a reflection of India\u2019s macro-economic fundamentals, is more as a result of capital outflow and appreciation in the dollar\u2019s value due to interest rate hikes in the US.\nDriven by strong domestic demand and capital expenditure \npush from the government, India will be one of the major beacons of growth in 2023-24. The Indian economy is expected to grow by 6.5% in 2023-24. Several high-frequency indicators suggest that the Indian economy is on course to meet the growth projection for the year. The year 2023-24 is expected to see faster growth in investment, thanks to sound macroeconomic policies & fundamentals and robust balance sheets of corporates and banks. Global geopolitical tensions, slowdown in the global economy & volatility due to new stress events in global financial systems pose a downside risk to the growth outlook.\ntreNDs iN the GLobAL oiL AND GAs sector\nThe global energy markets were engulfed by a crisis very \ndifferent from the ones in the past as the major primary energy sources, viz., crude, gas and coal were disrupted in a scale of unprecedented breadth and complexity. Russia has been among the largest exporter of fossil fuels, but its chocking of natural gas to Europe and EU sanctions on imports of oil and coal from Russia has severely impaired global energy trade.\nThe spot prices of natural gas had reached levels never \nseen before, regularly exceeding the equivalent of USD 250 for a barrel of oil. Coal prices had also hit record levels, while oil rose well above USD 100 per barrel in mid-2022 before falling back. High gas and coal prices account for 90% of the upward pressure on electricity costs around the world. The crisis has stoked inflationary pressures and created a looming risk of recession.\n\nThe loss of the Russian pipeline gas supply to the EU \nin 2022, which accounted for almost 20% of the gas consumption, drove the LNG prices to record highs.

Japan regained the spot as the \ntop LNG importer as China\u2019s LNG demand fell due to \nits zero-COVID policies and increased imports of natural \ngas by pipeline from Russia. Other Asian countries \nreduced spot purchases because of high LNG prices. Natural gas spot prices reached historic highs. \nBrent crude oil prices averaged $100.93 per barrel \nin 2022, up from $70.86 per barrel in 2021. With energy markets remaining extremely vulnerable, \ntoday\u2019s energy shock is a reminder of the fragility and \nunsustainability of our current energy system. Global \noil markets are gradually settling in after the worst \nenergy crisis in 50 years. Oil prices retreated in the last few months due to concerns over the global economy \nand slacking demand for oil. Gains that followed the \nsurprise announcement by some OPEC+ countries to cut production got reversed as concerns remained \nover the challenging macroeconomic environment. The \nsector is in fl  ux, with prices not behaving in line with forecasts by reputed agencies. \nGlobal crude oil production rose by little more than 5% \nin 2022 despite the sanctions on Russia from Western countries. Russian export volumes, in the end, remained \nmore or less at similar levels, with several other importers \nlike India and China picking up Russian cargoes. \nOn the supply side, oil fl  ows from Russia have remained \nhigher than expected, which kept a check on the prices. In April 2023, OPEC+ members agreed to cut oil \nproduction through 2023, which took the markets by \nsurprise. In June 2023, Saudi Arabia announced that \nthe country\u2019s output would drop on top of the broader \nOPEC+ deal to limit supply into 2024. \nEnergy-related CO\n2 emissions grew in 2022 by 0.9%, \nor 321 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT), reaching a record \nhigh of over 36.8 billion tonnes. The growth of renewable sources, including solar, wind and electric vehicles (EVs), helped slow the rise in emissions. Emissions \nin 2022 were lower compared with 2021, which saw a jump of over 6% due to economic rebound. Emissions \nstill remain on an unsustainable growth trajectory, \nneeding accelerated clean energy transition.\nThe Brent-Dubai differential, an important parameter \nimpacting profi  tability of domestic refi  neries, was largely positive, with Brent crude trading at a premium to Dubai \ncrude for almost the whole of the year. The differential \naveraged at a premium of USD 3.62 per barrel in the \nyear 2022-23, as against a premium of USD 2.7 per \nbarrel in the previous year. The premium increased \nsignifi  cantly in Q1 of the year 2022-23, mainly due to reduced US production, expectations of Iranian crude coming to market and prospects of Russian barrels to be replaced by Brent related crude oils, especially in Europe. However, it got tapered down due to concerns \nabout the possible economic recession and severe \nCOVID-19 containment measures in China. \nMoving in tandem with international prices of crude \noil, the petroleum product prices also witnessed high \nvolatility and steep rise in prices. The prices of Motor \nSpirit (petrol) (Unleaded Singapore Platts) and High-Speed Diesel (diesel) (Gasoil Singapore Platts) averaged higher, at USD 106.82 per barrel and USD 132.95 per barrel, respectively, in 2022-23, as against USD 89.7 per barrel and USD 90.6 per barrel in the previous year.

This trend is due to the lack of new discoveries, diminishing output from matured fields and operational issues encountered in some fields.\nIndia imported 232.7 MMT of crude in 2022-23, up from \n212.4 MMT in the preceding year. The import bill for crude oil surged 31% on a year-to-year basis to $158.3 billion. India\u2019s gross petroleum imports, which include crude oil and petroleum products, totalled 277.3 MMT, incurring an expense of $184.4 billion. This is as compared to 251.4 MMT in the previous year, amounting to outflow of $144.3 billion. India exported 61 MMT petroleum products worth $57.3 billion, compared with 62.8 MMT or $44.4 billion worth of products in 2021-22. India\u2019s reliance on imported crude increased to 87.3% of domestic consumption in 2022-23, up from 85.5% in 2021-22. Oil import dependency was 84.4% in 2020-21, 85% in 2019-20, and 83.8% in 2018-19. The production of petroleum products from domestic crude oil was 28.2 MMT in 2022-23, roughly 12.7%, down from 14.5% in 2021-22. Processing of high sulphur crude in total crude processing rose to 77.5% in 2022-23 from 76.6% in 2021-22. During 2022-23, natural gas production rose slightly to \n34,450 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meters (MMSCM) and consumption in India fell to around 60,000 MMSCM from 64,159 MMSCM in the previous year. LNG imports into India fell 14% to around 26,000 MMSCM during the year. \nIndia\u2019s expected growth rates for the next ten years and the \ngrowth rate of automobile sales, even with rising adoption of EVs, clearly indicates that the current demand levels for auto fuels will remain strong at least for the next ten years. Until heavy vehicles and buses adopt alternate fuels, including CNG, demand for liquid auto fuels will remain strong. International Energy Agency (IEA) says India\u2019s oil demand could rise to 6.7 mb/d by 2030 and to 7.4 mb/d by 2040.\nHaving achieved the target of 10% ethanol blending in \n2022, India has advanced the target of achieving 20% ethanol blending and 5% biodiesel blending to the years 2025 and 2030, respectively. India is also witnessing early signs of transition towards EVs on the back of policy mandates. However, the challenges related to battery technology and the range-anxiety of EVs remain, which are being addressed.\nMost of the growth in renewables energy is expected to \ncome from solar and wind.

The average worldwide temperature \nreached 17.23\u00b0C (63.01\u00b0F) in July, which is a record. The rising temperatures are increasing the frequency \nof extreme weather events in recent years. Despite strong governmental intent, carbon emissions have only \nincreased since the Paris Climate Change Conference, COP 2015. Therefore, more commitments are needed \nurgently. India has made the historic announcement of reaching Net Zero by the year 2070. To achieve \nthis milestone, the scale of transformation required in India is massive, given the country\u2019s galloping energy \nneeds due to a growing economy, industrialisation, and \nurbanisation.\nAbout $2.8 trillion is set to be invested globally in energy \nin 2023, of which more than $1.7 trillion is expected to \ngo to clean technologies \u2013 including renewables, EVs, \nand nuclear power. The remainder, slightly more than \n$1 trillion, is going to coal, gas, and oil. This means \naround 60% investment is flowing in renewables and \nthe rest in fossil fuels. \nThe path to becoming net zero carbon companies \nopened many revenue-generating opportunities. There \nhas been a rapid growth of renewable energy in India\u2019s \nenergy mix in recent years. India is currently ranked 4\nth \nin renewable energy installed capacity and the share \nof renewable energy is continuously on the rise due to strong policy support and a fall in input costs. Green \nmobility and the proliferation of renewable energy are \nincreasingly becoming viable due to the continuous \ndevelopment in technology, which is driving down the \ncost while increasing efficiency. Massive government \npolicy support, as well as a growing environmental \nawareness is spurring the adoption of electric vehicles. \nElectricity generation via solar and wind offers significant \nopportunities. Investment in solar is set to overtake \nthe amount of investment going into oil production for the first time, an IEA study has revealed.  India has \nhuge potential for solar energy, and the cost of solar power has come down. Other technologies that could \nattract investments are those relating to battery storage technology, pumped hydro, and upgraded intelligent \nelectricity grids.  Some of these areas in renewables will serve as high-investment and innovation areas requiring sustained focus and support from companies, including \ntraditional oil and gas companies. \nbiofuels are expected to play an important role in the \noil and gas industry in promoting energy sustainability \nand security as India progresses toward a clean energy \necosystem. Long-Term Offtake Agreements between oil \ncompanies and ethanol plants have been helping. India \nachieved the targeted 10% ethanol blending in May \n2022, much ahead of the target date of November 2022 \nand has gone on to prepone the timeline by 5 years to \n2025 for an ambitious blending target of 20%. \nThe National Policy on Biofuels announced in 2018 by \nthe Government of India put thrust on the production of \nadvanced biofuels such as 2G ethanol, CBG, Waste to Fuels, \ndrop-in fuels etc., through the utilization of indigenous \nfeedstocks. India set a target of 5% biodiesel blending in \ndiesel by 2030. The Policy encourages the setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from \nnon-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil (UCO), and short \ngestation crops. \u2018SATAT\u2019 (Sustainable Alternative Towards \nAffordable Transportation) initiative on Compressed Bio-Gas (cbG) envisages production of 15 MMT of CBG and \n50 MMT of manure from 5,000 CBG plants.\nhydrogen is increasingly being seen not only as a \npotential solution to the predicaments of the present \nglobal energy system \u2013 mainly climate change and air\n\n50 MMT of manure from 5,000 CBG plants.\nhydrogen is increasingly being seen not only as a \npotential solution to the predicaments of the present \nglobal energy system \u2013 mainly climate change and air \npollution \u2013 but also as a means of scaling up ways of \ncomplementing other clean energy forms. Presently, \nhydrogen is primarily being used as feedstock in many \nindustries. However, with technological advancements \nin electrolyzers (for Green hydrogen) and developments in carbon capture and storage technology (ccs used for \nblue hydrogen), it is expected to be the clean fuel for \nthe future, notably to be utilized by the many countries \npledging for carbon neutrality and reducing emissions in \nline with the Paris Agreement. According to the recently \nheld COP26 summit in Glasgow, hydrogen is integral \nto the global 2050 vision, with nearly 30 countries \nreleasing hydrogen roadmaps. \nGreen hydrogen is widely regarded as an ideal, \nclean solution. A steady but consistent adoption of green hydrogen will be the way to go. The possibility \nof integrating hydrogen with the existing gas infrastructure offers immense potential. Currently \nthe challenges in transportation and storage remain. Subsequent applications could be in the area of \nmobility through hydrogen fuel cells, but that could be some distance away.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited64\nAviation fuel demand is expected to continue to \ngrow at 3.5% CAGR but will be gradually substituted \nby sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) due to Carbon \nOffsetting and Reduction Scheme for International \nAviation (CORSIA) mandates. As India is a low per capita energy consumption country, the mandates could vary. \nDemand for petrochemicals has been robust for \ntheir use in multiple sectors. Petrochemicals offer a natural hedge and a significant diversification \nopportunity against the expected long-term decline in \noil consumption. The petrochemical sector is projected \nto emerge as the primary driver of growth for the global \noil and gas sector, accounting for more than a third of incremental oil demand by 2030. India\u2019s reliance on petrochemical imports has been high, and adding \na petrochemical complex near or as part of a refinery \nwould significantly benefit energy companies.\nIndia has taken an ambitious target of increasing the \nshare of natural gas in its primary energy basket to \n15% by 2030. Growth in LPG demand is expected to \ndecline after seven to eight years, ceding ground to Piped Natural Gas (PNG), for which massive City Gas Distribution (cGD) grid expansion is underway, and \nthen to the electrification of cooking.  Demand will be stable, but incremental demand could be met through PNG. CGD network will continue to be an area of growth \nfor energy companies, as there is a greater shift towards \nurbanization and a growing preference for apartment complexes, even in smaller cities.  \nIn this new landscape of competing energy sources, it \nis important that companies continue to invest in better technologies for exploration and production of oil and gas. Immediate tapering of investments in fossil fuels \nwould impact energy security. \nAlthough a decline in the contribution of oil and gas in \nthe primary energy basket is imminent over time, one cannot wish away hydrocarbons. It is likely that demand \nfor hydrocarbons will remain relevant for global energy \nneeds. Considering India\u2019s expected growth rates for the next 10 years and the growth rate of automobile sales, even with the rising adoption of EVs, the current demand levels for liquid auto fuels will hold for several \nyears. Until heavy vehicles and buses adopt alternate \nfuels, including CNG, demand for liquid auto fuels will remain strong.\nUpstream spending has fallen from around USD 700 \nbillion in 2014 to around USD 370-400 billion in 2022. While this reflects the expansion in energy industry to include alternative cleaner form of energy and a \ngradual move away from fossil fuels, this is very low considering the continued demand for oil and gas. The \naverage global decline rate of oil fields is around 6%, \nwhich means oil & gas companies have to invest in new projects to maintain production levels. In addition to the \nabove, the recent geopolitical tensions have highlighted \nhow vulnerable the global energy system is and the right \nbalance has to be found while prioritizing sustainability \nover energy security.\nrisKs, coNcerNs, AND oUtLooK\nThe last year was different in the sense that energy was \nweaponized. The instability that defined the oil & gas \nmarket for much of last year has continued into 2023. The events happening in European markets, OPEC+ \ndecisions and other geopolitical hotspots like Iran, \nLibya, etc. will have a major bearing on the direction oil & gas markets take. The global oil & gas markets \nare experiencing significant volatility due to the ongoing \ndemand-supply imbalance.\nFor the sake of energy security and to prevent volatility, \nhealthy investments and optimal use of the existing \nassets become imperative. As demand continues to surge, underinvestment could hurt countries and companies. Better international cooperation, faster development of potential fields, structured \ninvestments in short-gestation assets and enhancing\n\ninvestments in short-gestation assets and enhancing \nextraction efficiency, along with leveraging research and development while lowering emissions, will be \ncritical. In view of climate mandates, today global oil & \ngas companies are facing dilemma in capital allocation between ensuring energy security verses meeting sustainability goals. \nThe outcome of the war in Ukraine will have a potentially \nlasting impact on the oil & gas industry. As Europe secures energy supply for 2023-24 winter, South & Southeast Asian markets may struggle to compete, with \nthe agriculture sector likely to suffer the most as high \ngas prices keep fertilizer cost high. This situation is particularly problematic for countries like India that rely \nheavily on imports, to meet oil and gas needs.\nOil & gas companies have worldwide operations and a \ncomplex ecosystem of partners and suppliers. If even one of these third party experience a cyber breach, it \ncould put anyone in the network at risk, as is evident \nfrom the incidents in the recent past.\nIndia's electricity demand is expected to grow more \nrapidly than the rate of growth of its overall energy\n\nAnnual Report 2022-2365\ndemand. This will, in turn, put significant pressure on \ngrids and battery storage. The situation poses both a challenge and an opportunity to oil & gas companies. Climate change, heat waves and strong economic growth will continue to nudge demand for electricity higher. In an environment of energy transition, creatively reimagining and repositioning business diversification into adjacencies are crucial steps to survive and grow. To that extent, there will be substantial opportunities for the Company\u2019s plans for solar energy.\nThe Indian Rupee displayed surprising resilience. \nIt became the most stable currency, at least among emerging market peers. Its implied volatility, the metric that captures the market\u2019s view of the likelihood of fluctuations in its value, is at its lowest since 2008. This is despite a sharp rise in the dollar index during the year because of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive interest rate-raising campaign.\nBelying market fears of a possible spike in India\u2019s \nexternal vulnerabilities, India\u2019s current account deficit at 2% of GDP during 2022-23 remained sustainable, although it expanded from 1.2% a year ago. The merchandise trade deficit widened to $265.3 billion from $189.5 billion a year ago. This, combined with lower net capital inflows than in the previous year, led to depletion in the foreign exchange reserves to the tune of $9.1 billion on a balance of payments basis during 2022-23. Including valuation effects, however, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves declined by US$ 28.9 billion during 2022-23. Forex reserves in July 2023 stood at USD 609 billion. \nWith the US and other major economies raising \ninterest rates or keeping them high for a long time, \ncountries like India and even China would find it hard \nto cut interest rates or take other measures to support \ndomestic demand. Any premature interest rate cuts \nby emerging market countries could trigger capital \noutflows and weaken domestic currencies. Exchange rate depreciation remains a key risk for the country and all the oil marketing companies. The central bank could be inclined to shore up its foreign exchange reserves to be able to build buffers to deal with external volatility, including in crude oil prices.\nIn addition to currency risks, the central bank\u2019s interest \nrate policies have moved into a restrictive stance from \nan accommodative stance, which could further have a \nbearing on cost of capital for corporates.\nSafe and environmentally responsible operations \nbecome even more critical in the oil & gas industry, as the products are naturally hazardous. Safety and \nsecurity of assets and people and a cleaner environment \nare always priorities. At BPCL, we continuously reinforce the laid-down operating and safety systems \nand processes and sharpen our capabilities for disaster \nmanagement. Continuous education and workforce training are essential to adhere to standard operating \nprocedures and avoid human errors. A culture of safety and readiness has been inculcated through simulated \nstress tests periodically. Upkeep and maintenance of assets reduce the chances of breakdowns and accidents \nwhile ensuring better operational availability. The \ncompany makes available considerable resources in this endeavour. As companies and economies benefit from \ntechnology and digital infrastructure, they also have to ward off cyberattack risks, and utmost care will have to \nbe taken to insulate the company from financial loss, supply-chain interruptions, and reputational damage. \nControlled hackathons could be a way.\nBPCL is agile in dealing with challenges as well as \nin seizing opportunities. With the energy sector in transition, the strategic focus is to diversify and \nexpand into alternative and adjacent revenue streams \nlike petrochemicals, renewables, electric mobility, and \nconsumer retailing, while constantly improvising on its \ncore business.

Through a \nblend of proactive planning, effective risk management, \nimplementing technology-driven solutions and making \ninformed decisions, BPCL group refineries recorded a \nformidable operational performance in the financial year, \nclocking the highest ever throughput of 38.53 million \nmetric tonnes (MMT). The group refineries also placed on \nthe record the highest-ever Gross Refinery Margin (GRM) of $20.24 per barrel. This remarkable performance reflects \nyour Company\u2019s ability to optimize the refining operations, \nmaximize product yields, and effectively manage costs. \nAll three refineries surpassed their design capacity \nand registered an average capacity utilization of 109%, notwithstanding the major turnarounds of Mumbai and \nKochi refineries. This remarkable accomplishment is\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited66\nparticularly noteworthy considering the robust demand for \ntransportation fuel in Indian market. \nA broad glimpse of refinery performance is provided \nbelow, shedding light on specific initiatives and strategic interventions behind the delivering of a strong physical \nand financial performance whilst the Company traversed \nchallenging situations. These initiatives encompassed cutting-edge digital transformations, a steadfast focus on energy efficiency, meticulous optimization efforts, a culture \nof innovation, and a proactive approach to embracing \nemerging technologies to improve reliability. Each of these elements played a crucial role in ensuring the continued success of the group refineries, enabling them to rise above the challenges.\nThe merger of BORL with BPCL marked a significant \nstep towards consolidating resources, expertise, and \ncapabilities to create a stronger and more integrated \nrefining entity. This integration represented a strategic focus on strengthening the overall business operations. By bringing BORL under the umbrella of BPCL, Bina Refinery has emerged as a powerful force in the Indian refining \nindustry, poised to leverage synergies and maximize \noperational efficiencies.\nIn the face of challenges, innovation becomes a vital tool \nfor providing solutions and meeting ever-evolving needs of customer. In this financial year, a new specialty product called \u201cD40\u201d was launched. It is an industrial solvent that \noffers unique properties and characteristics, catering to a \nvariety of industrial applications, including for paint and metal industries. Furthermore, the LOBS unit undertook a significant project to develop and commercialize smokeless kerosene to meet the requirements of Indian Army. The \ntraditional kerosene faced issues related to combustion \nquality and smoke generation at higher altitudes, posing challenges for Army operations in those regions. \nAt BPCL, enhancing energy efficiency is one of the key \nfocus areas. Improving energy efficiency in refineries not \nonly helps to reduce operational costs but also minimizes \nenvironmental footprint and contributes to sustainable development. By adopting strategies such as process optimization, advanced control systems, energy recovery, equipment upgrades, renewable energy integration, and \nemployee engagement, refineries can simultaneously \nunlock substantial energy savings, reduce emissions, and achieve sustainable and cost-effective operations. \nInstallation of Flexible Removable Insulation Jackets (FRIC), \nimplementation of Electrical Heat Tracing (EHT), changing of turbine drive to motor, installation of Welded Plate Type \nHeat Exchangers in place of shell and tube exchangers, \ninstallation of Variable Fluid Coupling, replacement of Air \nFin Cooler (AFC) fan blades with new-generation energy-\nefficient E-Glass Epoxy Fibre Reinforced Plastic (EFRP) \nblades are some of the key energy-efficient activities \ncarried out by the refineries during the financial year. \nCumulatively, the refineries have implemented initiatives \nleading to a potential saving of 78,064 metric tonnes of \noil equivalent (MTOE), which corresponds to a reduction \nin emissions of 2.4 lakh metric tonnes of CO\n2 equivalent \n(MTCO 2e). For comprehensive information on the specific \nenergy efficiency and energy conservation initiatives undertaken by the refineries, kindly refer to Annexure-A of \nthis report. It is pertinent to mention that these initiatives \ndemonstrate your Company\u2019s commitment to sustainable \npractices and driving positive change in energy.\nIn the year 2022-23, a series of impactful activities were \ncarried out to promote environmental sustainability and address key challenges. These initiatives encompassed \nvarious areas, including afforestation, water conservation, \nand waste reduction, apart from energy efficiency. Under \nthe banner of Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment), a comprehensive campaign was launched to address\n\nand waste reduction, apart from energy efficiency. Under \nthe banner of Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment), a comprehensive campaign was launched to address \ncritical environmental issues. This campaign covered \nvarious themes, including energy conservation, water \nconservation, elimination of single-use plastic, waste \nreduction, and e-waste reduction. Through awareness \nprograms, educational initiatives, and community \nengagement, these campaigns aimed to instil sustainable \npractices and encourage positive behaviour change toward \nthe environment.\nTo combat water scarcity and promote sustainable water \nmanagement, efforts were made to develop facilities \nfor rainwater harvesting. With combined efforts from \nrefineries, cumulative savings of 4.12 lakh kilolitres of \nwater was achieved through rainwater harvesting. Apart \nfrom regular tree plantation initiatives, the Miyawaki \nmethod of tree plantation was also adopted in our \nrefineries, wherein saplings of native species were \ndiligently planted. This approach, known for its dense \nand diverse forest creation, aimed to restore and enhance \nthe natural ecosystem. By focusing on native species, the initiative aimed to preserve native biodiversity and promote \necological balance. To ensure effective implementation and monitoring of environmental strategies, the \u201cEnvironment \nChampion\u201d strategy was introduced in each refinery. This\n\nAnnual Report 2022-2367\napproach emphasized an \u2018Ownership\u2019 mindset among the \nprocess teams, fostering a sense of responsibility and active participation. The champions played a crucial role in driving change, promoting new ideas, and implementing improvements to enhance environmental performance and control. Overall, the activities carried out during this period demonstrated a proactive and comprehensive approach of your Company towards environmental sustainability.\nAs India continues its rapid development, there is a \nsubstantial projected increase in energy demand over the coming decades. To meet this growing demand, the country is actively seeking new projects in the oil and gas fields. These projects are aimed at ensuring a reliable and sustainable energy supply to support the nation's economic growth and meet the needs of its expanding population. In the current fiscal year, three major projects were successfully commissioned. The details of the projects, viz., Kerosene Hydrotreater Unit (KHT), \u2018Lube Oil Base Stock (LOBS)\u2019 revamp and De-Aromatized Solvent (DAS) are provided in this Annual Report under the head \u2018Major Projects\u2019. \nSignificant strides were made towards the digital \ntransformation of refineries, aligning with the objective of Go Digital! New projects were initiated and successfully completed, focusing on cutting-edge technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics Process Automation (RPA), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), new applications, Advanced Process Control (APC) models, and infrastructure development. These initiatives are aimed at enhancing operational efficiency, optimizing processes, and leveraging innovative solutions to improve overall refinery performance. A Study Project was undertaken for carving out Digital Strategy and Roadmap for BPCL Refineries. This was titled Project Utkarsh and as an outcome, key digital initiatives related to various functions, viz., reliability improvement, reduction in energy consumption, etc. were identified, reviewed for implementation and are being pursued as per business priorities in the year 2023-24 and beyond. \nDigital solutions were deployed during the turnarounds \nat refineries to facilitate turnaround planning and to bring in productivity improvement and safety. This came to be recognized as \u2018Digital\u2019 turnaround. The Digital team ensured close monitoring of turnaround progress, resource mobilization and critical path evaluation in the first \u2018Mega Turnaround\u2019 of Kochi Refinery (KR) and achieved on-time completion without any cost escalation. Machine Learning-based models were developed and deployed at all three \nrefineries for addressing various business problems, some \nof them being prediction of propylene purity, C3 Stripper \nBottom propylene purity, Anomaly Detection for Recycle \nGas Compressors in Naphtha Hydrogen Treating Unit \nand for enhancing process reliability. Advanced Process Control (APC) has been implanted in critical process \nunits and is currently being standardized across the three \nrefineries, which enhances consistent control strategies, knowledge sharing and best practices.\nThe refineries also rolled-out in-house developed digital \nsolution tools, viz., \u201cBPMARRK: Real-time Crude Oil \nCharacterization Software\u201d and \u201cK Model for Crude Oil Compatibilities\u201d, which enables the refineries to optimize the crude mix and refinery operations.\nretAiLThe Indian economy showed a broad-based growth in \n2022-23, led by a strong domestic demand, as several \nsectors reached their pre-pandemic demand levels.

The need for this CSR intervention is justified through lack of limited medical diagnostic testing facilities in the \nproject area namely SCB Hospital located in Cuttack. The facility \nallowed for an early diagnosis for specific illnesses for about 25-40% of the referred patients. The reduced turnaround time of diagnosis reportedly leads to relevant treatment to start early and therefore results in faster recovery. The provision of a modern diagnostic \nfacility within the same hospital building results in efficient inter \ndepartmental coordination, that benefits the patients. Because of the upgraded ICU facilities, advanced medical treatment has been made possible.\n2 Skill Development Training Programme for 940 persons in Shrawasti (Uttar Pradesh) and Mewat \n(Haryana)  1.94  1.93 Manav Vikas \nSansthaShrawasti (Uttar Pradesh) and Mewat (Haryana) A project to impart skill training to individuals in Shravasti and Mewat/Nuh aspirational districts to become self-employed tailors and hand embroiderers was undertaken.

The need for \nthis CSR intervention is justified as the critical patients did not have \nlimited provision of comprehensive care at the medical facility. As a result of this project, there is a reported reduction in the number of referral cases by the doctors at GMC. The treatment of critical patients \ncan be done at the upgraded facility. This situation has resulted in \nproviding a more comprehensive and focused treatment to the ailing patients: resulting in low mortality among critical patients.\n7 Construction of Laboratory \nblock for Govt.

Our findings are that the construction is of extremely good quality and is being maintained well. Further discussions with key stakeholders revealed that the laboratories constructed under the project were reported to be not functional to its full capacity because \nof a) lack of equipment and teaching aids b) shortage of furniture \nfor students c) lack of supply of water/gas in the laboratories. As a result of these shortcomings, the project has not been able to have evident impact on academic improvement.The facility has potential \nto provide good exposure to students and help them perform in \nscience competions if the above shortcomings are addressed.

I am delighted to present to you the first edition of Bharat Petroleum\u2019s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (previously known as the Business Responsibility Report). The report has been prepared as per the formats provided by the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI). \n Today, corporations across the globe are being assessed on their ESG performance. As a public sector undertaking tasked with providing energy security to the citizens of the country, BPCL has always adhered to the principles of responsible business in conducting its operations. BPCL is one of the early adopters of ESG reporting in India. The Company first published its Sustainability Report way back in the year 2006. Over the years, the Company has been improving its disclosures, in line with the GRI standards.\n It has been our topmost priority to uphold the principles of Corporate Governance to ensure transparency, integrity, and accountability in our functioning. We have in place strong frameworks that maintain high standards of ethical and responsible conduct of business. BPCL rigorously follows best HR practices. The Company encourages inclusive growth by providing employment and training opportunities to weaker sections of the society. Safety and well-being of our employees and contractual workers have always been a priority area of work. Safety continues to be the baseline of all our actions. We need to strengthen our culture of safety by being both proactive and prepared in the work environment as well as off work. \n BPCL is a responsible global citizen. As the flagship oil company of the country, BPCL has ensured that critical energy needs are met across the length and breadth of the country even during natural disasters or periods of national emergency. The Company is the leading implementing agency for many community development schemes of the Government of India such as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), providing free LPG connections to BPL women, etc. BPCL R&D has pioneered several indigenous technologies in process/product improvements, in the spirit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Our procurement policies are aligned to support and promote MSMEs and start-ups. BPCL is also the leading company in implementing the SATAT scheme of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, promoting indigenously produced Compressed Biogas (CBG). Through this scheme, BPCL is also helping in creating rural employment opportunities and nurturing entrepreneurship. Beyond this, BPCL has a dedicated CSR programme which undertakes various community development initiatives across the country.\n Through its efforts in emission mitigation, water and energy conservation, waste reduction, improvement in energy efficiency, BPCL has been proactively working towards reducing its operational impact on the environment. At the same time, the Company is also focusing towards greening its product mix through investments in renewable energy, biofuels, hydrogen, cleaner petroleum products and encouraging circular economy. In our supply chain, BPCL is encouraging digital connect to make supply chain more efficient and reduce emissions.\n\nLast year we have achieved a total sale of 48.92 MMT which is highest ever in BPCL. We have also achieved No. 1 position in market share growth across the industry in all products combined i.e., 25.07%. Our refineries have ably supported and processed 38.41 MMT crude (capacity utilization of 108.8%) against the MOU target of 37.25 MMT. We have commissioned 986 new fuel stations, 482 CNG stations, 680 EV fast charging stations along 80 + highway corridors and added 37 LPG distributorships spread across the country. We have commissioned 4 AdBlue (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) plants there by reducing our Carbon Footprint and recycled 3172 MT of waste plastic under Extended Producer Responsibility. After the latest CGD bid round, BPCL has 25 Geographical Areas (GAs) on\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited162\nstandalone basis and along with our JV companies, \nwe have enviable portfolio of GAs which covers 19% \nof India\u2019s population.\n We are now amid a transition phase to a low-\ncarbon energy system and must do so profitably \nwhile considering our net zero ambition of being \nthere by 2040. Our forays into new energies such \nas renewables, electric mobility, biofuels and \nelectrolyser present the agile face of BPCL, keeping us relevant in the mind space of the new-age Indian consumer who is increasingly driven for choice \nthrough socially relevant corporate values such \nas ESG. Therefore, we need to ensure that all new \nprojects we take up are done with a low carbon \nfootprint in mind. This will help us getting future ready for our net zero ambitions.\n To further add the nations\u2019 objective of boosting green fuel and self-reliance, BPCL has achieved 10.59% of ethanol blending and are now selling CBG at 41 outlets. A 20 MW green hydrogen project at Bina and the expansion of Solar and Wind portfolio is aggressively underway. We have benchmarked \nBPCL sustainability initiatives on various national \nand international platforms like the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), etc. BPCL has maintained No. 1 rank in Indian oil and gas sector for its sustainability performance in the 2022 edition of the S&P DJSI \nrankings for the third consecutive year. We are \nthe 8\nth best company all over the world out of 29 \ncompanies assessed in oil and gas sector with \nrespect to sustainability. \n BPCL has also benchmarked its performance on \nCarbon Disclosure Project (CDP) platform for \nSustainability and Climate Change and maintained its \nrating at \u201cManagement Level\u201d consistently for third year in a row in 2021-22, which is the best amongst Indian oil and gas companies and is on par with international peers.\n The Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR) presents a snapshot of BPCL\u2019s ESG journey \nand performance during the last financial year. \nWhile we have attempted to provide a response to all Essential and Leadership indicators, BPCL \ncontinues to improve upon its systems and matrices further so that disclosures can become better in \nfuture. Various sections of the report can be cross-\nreferenced with our other annual public disclosures, i.e., the Sustainability Report and Annual Report, \nfor more details.\n Looking ahead, BPCL has geared up to meet the \nchallenges of climate change, environmental \ndegradation, and environmental sustainability, \nthereby making strategic shift towards meeting the aspirations set by UN Sustainable Development \nGoals and Net Zero transition.

We have audited the accompanying Standalone Indian Accounting Standards (\u201cInd AS\u201d) Financial Statements \nof Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (\u201cthe Corporation\u201d), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date, and a summary of the Significant Accounting Policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements \u201d).\n2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (\u201cInd AS\u201d), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Corporation as at March 31, 2023, the profit and total comprehensive income, its cash flows and changes in equity for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for Opinion\n3. We conducted our audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on \nAuditing (\u201cSAs\u201d) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Corporation in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u2019s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.\nKey Audit Matters\n4. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of \nthe Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23227\nS.No. Key Audit Matter Auditors\u2019 Response\n1. Valuation of Investment in E&P Subsidiary \n(Refer Note 7 and Note 56):\nThe Corporation has an investment of \nRs.9,601.37 crores in 100% subsidiary Bharat \nPetro Resources Ltd (BPRL). This subsidiary along with its stepdown subsidiaries, JVs & Associates holds participating interest in various oil/gas blocks for exploration & evaluation, development, and production activities (E&P).\nThe Corporation\u2019s realisation from these E&P \ninvestments is dependent on the continued successful operations/development of reserves resulting in expected earnings and revenue growth of the respective companies. BPRL has relinquished or impaired certain oil and gas blocks on account of changes in circumstances and prospects of the blocks.\nThe above factors have impacted the value in \nuse of BPRL\u2019s assets and consequently the Corporation\u2019s impairment analysis in respect of its Investment in BPRL. Accordingly, we considered this as a Key Audit Matter.The following procedures were carried out in this regard:\n\u2022 We evaluated the design, implementation and \noperating effectiveness of key controls in relation to the annual impairment testing activity carried out by the Corporation for its investments in Subsidiary.\n\u2022 We reviewed the audited consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements of BPRL for FY 2022-23 and the independent auditor\u2019s report thereon.\n\u2022 We assessed the Management\u2019s explanation regarding key factors which have led to significant diminution in value of BPRL\u2019s assets vis-\u00e0-vis the previous year and consequent trigger for impairment of the Corporation\u2019s investment in the same.\n\u2022 We evaluated the impairment analysis carried out during the year by the Corporation, which included an independent comparison of externally / internally assessed value in use of BPRL\u2019s Net Assets with carrying cost of investment in BPRL in the Corporation\u2019s Books of Account.\n2. Computation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL):\nTrade receivables and loans granted under the Pradhan Mantri Ujwala Yojana (PMUY) scheme constitute a significant component of the total current assets of the Corporation. At each reporting date, the Corporation recognizes Lifetime ECL on Trade Receivables using a \u2018simplified approach\u2019 and 12 month ECL on loans are granted under the PMUY scheme wherein we relied on Management\u2019s estimates regarding probability of default rates linked to age-wise bucketing of the corresponding asset. Since, this is a technical matter based on probable outcome of default, we considered this as a Key Audit Matter.Our audit approach consisted testing of the design implementation and operating effectiveness of the internal controls and substantive testing as follows:\n\u2022 In respect of loans granted under PMUY, the \nCorporation along with other few industry peers have derived a common methodology for calculating ECL, based on the broad category of active and inactive consumers and last refill date with expected loan recovery period. We checked the working of the same and it is in line with the common methodology document shared with us.\n\u2022 We have evaluated the methodology for age-wise bucketing of trade receivables and key assumptions underlying the probability of default estimates on the same, to ascertain that the same were broadly in-line with the Corporation\u2019s historical default rates and have considered available information regarding the current economic scenario.\n\u2022 We selected a few sample outstanding receivable cases having different overdue periods and checked that the computation of ECL has been appropriately carried out in line with the Corporation\u2019s policy.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited228\nS.No. Key Audit Matter Auditors\u2019 Response\n3. Evaluation of Contingent Liabilities:\nContingent liabilities disclosed are in respect of \nitems which in each case are above the threshold limit. The Corporation has material uncertain positions including matters under dispute which involves significant judgment to determine the possible outcome of these disputes. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote. In view of significant management estimate and judgement involved, we considered this as a Key Audit Matter.The following audit procedures were carried out in this regard:\n\u2022 We examined sample items above the threshold \nlimit for determination of contingent liabilities and obtained details of completed Excise, VAT/ Sales Tax/ Entry Tax assessments, demands as well as other disputed claims against the Corporation as on March 31, 2023. The Corporation has obtained opinion from tax consultants in various disputed matters. We have relied upon such opinions and litigation history where the Corporation has concluded that possibility of cash outflow is remote while preparing its Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.\n\u2022 We have assessed the Management\u2019s underlying assumptions in estimating the possible outcome of such disputed claims/ cases against the Corporation, based on records and judicial precedents made available.\n4. Inventorie s:\nVerification and valuation of Inventories and related write down, if any, is a significant area requiring Management\u2019s judgment of estimates and application of accounting policies that have significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements. Accordingly, we considered this as a Key Audit Matter.Our audit approach involved the following combination of test of control design, implementations, operating effectiveness and substantive testing in respect of verification and valuation of inventories:\n\u2022 We evaluated the system of inventory monitoring \nand control. It was observed that inventory has been physically verified by the Management during the year at reasonable intervals.\n\u2022 Our audit teams have also physically verified on sample basis the Inventories at various locations and compliance with cut off procedures. However, since physical verification at certain locations was not possible for us, in such cases we have relied on the physical verification of inventory carried out by the Management.\n\u2022 In respect of inventory lying with third parties, we have ascertained that these have substantially been confirmed by them. We also examined the system of records maintenance for stocks lying at third party locations.\n\u2022 We have also tested the values considered in respect of Net realisable value, cost of products and verified these on sample basis with the inventory valuation and accounting entries posted in this regard.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23229\nS.No. Key Audit Matter Auditors\u2019 Response\n5.

Goodwil l:\nThe Corporation tests for impairment of Goodwill at each reporting date, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.\nAccordingly, we considered this as a Key Audit \nMatter.Our Audit Procedures included Test of Details in respect of the following:\n\u2022 Obtained an understanding from the management \nwith respect to process and controls followed by the Corporation to perform annual impairment test related to goodwill.\n\u2022 Obtained the impairment analysis model from the management and reviewed their conclusions.\n\u2022 We assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions used and appropriateness of the valuation methodology applied.\n\u2022 Tested the discount rate and long term growth rates used in the forecast including comparison to economic and industry forecasts where appropriate.\n\u2022 Assessed and validated the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures made by the management in the standalone financial statements.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited230\nS.No. Key Audit Matter Auditors\u2019 Response\n7. Information Technolog y: \nA significant part of the Corporation\u2019s financial \nreporting process is heavily reliant on IT systems with automated processes and controls over the capture, storage and extraction of information. A fundamental component of these processes and controls is ensuring appropriate user access and change management protocols exist and being adhered to.\nThese protocols are important because they \nensure that access and changes to IT systems and related data are made and authorized in an appropriate manner. As our audit sought to place a high level of reliance on IT systems and application controls related to financial reporting, high proportion of the overall audit effort was in Information Technology (IT) Systems and Controls.\nWe focused our audit on those IT systems and \ncontrols that are significant to the Corporation\u2019s financial reporting process.\nAccordingly, we considered this as a Key Audit \nMatter.Our procedures included:\nWe focused our audit on those IT systems and controls \nthat are relevant to preparation of financial statements for financial year ended 31\nst March 23.\nAs audit procedures over IT Systems and controls require specific expertise, we involved our IT specialist.\nOur review of the IT Controls covers the following areas:\u2022 Physical and Logical Security;\n\u2022 Change Management;\n\u2022 Backup, Business Continuity and\n\u2022 IT Operations.\nOur assessment of the IT Controls is performed according \nto the following approach:\n\u2022 Understanding the IT environment.\n\u2022 Information gathering about the control framework \nsurrounding the IT environment.\n\u2022 Evidence gathering with respect to Control testing.\n\u2022 Review of Implementation of controls testing.\n\u2022 Review of limited cases to identify whether there \nhad been unauthorized or inappropriate access or changes made to critical IT systems and related data.\nInformation Other than the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements and Auditors\u2019 Report Thereon\n5. The Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other \ninformation comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board\u2019s Report including Annexures to Board\u2019s Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder\u2019s Information, but does not include the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements and our audit report thereon.\n Our opinion on the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance thereon.\n6. In connection with our audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the \nStandalone Ind AS Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise \nappears to be materially misstated.\n7. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact to those charged with governance and review the steps taken by the management to communicate to those in receipt of the other information, if previously issued, to inform them of the revision. \n The Other information is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor\u2019s report and if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23231\nBoard of Directors / Management\u2019s Responsibility for the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements\n8. The Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect \nto the preparation of these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including the other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Corporation in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Corporation and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n9. In preparing the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Corporation\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Corporation or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n10. The Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors / Management is responsible for overseeing the Corporation\u2019s financial reporting process.\nAuditors\u2019 Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements\n11. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements \nas a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.\n12. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n \u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n \u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Corporation has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. \n \u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n \u2022 Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Corporation\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors\u2019 report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Corporation to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited232\n \u2022 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements, \nincluding the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n13. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Ind AS standalone financial statements.\n14. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n15. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n16. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to \noutweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n17. Other Matters\n A.  In terms of Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) Order dated June 22, 2022, \u2018Bharat Oman Refineries Limited\u2019 \n(BORL), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation has been amalgamated with the Corporation.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business including adherence to Corporation\u2019s policies, safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\nAuditors\u2019 Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation\u2019s internal financial controls over financial reporting based \non our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the \u201cGuidance Note\u201d) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls \nsystem over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Corporation\u2019s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nA Corporation\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance \nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Corporation\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the assets of the Corporation;\n2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23245\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of \nthe Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and\n3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of \ncollusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Corporation has, in all \nmaterial respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, except for the matter stated in Other Matter Paragraph, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the Corporation considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial \nControls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.\nOther Matter\n\u2018Hello-BPCL\u2019 Application:\na) Certain weaknesses in the Application \u2018Hello-BPCL\u2019 with respect to \u2018Advanced Loyalty Programme\u2019(ALP) which \nwere exploited by certain fleet card customers by fraudulently taking undue advantage and utilised certain ineligible recharges credited to their wallets without payment being received from customers as referred to in Clause (xi)(i)(a) in \u2018Annexure A\u2019 to our report; and\nb) Deficiency in the process of reconciliation of amounts received from customers through the payment aggregators.\nManagement has informed us that they have taken steps to fix these weaknesses.\nOur Opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter.\nWe have considered the above in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the \nMarch 31, 2023. The above (as explained in Note 43 of the Standalone financial statements) is not likely to affect our opinion on the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements of the Corporation.\nFor Kalyaniwalla & Mistry LLP For K.

The Corporation continually evaluates these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information.\n In particular, information about significant areas of estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Financial Statements are as below:\n \u2022 Assessment of functional currency;\n \u2022 Financial instruments;\n \u2022 Estimates of useful lives and residual value of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible assets;\n \u2022 Valuation of Inventories;\n \u2022 Measurement of recoverable amounts of Cash-Generating Units;\n \u2022 Measurement of Defined Benefit Obligations and actuarial assumptions;\n \u2022 Provisions including loss allowances;\n \u2022 Evaluation of recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets; and\n \u2022 Contingencies.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited254\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognized prospectively in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the \nperiod in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n1.3. Property, Plant and Equipment \n 1.3.1. Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. \n 1.3.2. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost (including import duties and non-refundable taxes), any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if any, and, borrowing cost for qualifying assets (i.e. assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use). \n 1.3.3. Direct expenses incurred during construction period on capital projects are capitalized. Other expenses of the project group which are allocated to projects costing above the threshold limit are also capitalized. Expenditure incurred on enabling assets are capitalized.\n 1.3.4. Gas distribution systems is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment when it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. \n 1.3.5. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Corporation.\n 1.3.6. Expenditure on assets, other than plant and machinery, LPG cylinders and pressure regulators, not exceeding the threshold limit are charged to revenue.\n 1.3.7. Spare parts which meet the definition of Property, Plant and Equipment are capitalized as Property, Plant and Equipment in case the unit value of the spare part is above the threshold limit. In other cases, the spare part is inventorized on procurement and charged to Statement of Profit and Loss on consumption.\n 1.3.8. An item of Property, Plant and Equipment and any significant part initially recognized separately as part of Property, Plant and Equipment is derecognized upon disposal; or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is included in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.\n 1.3.9. The residual values and useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and changes, if any, are accounted in line with revisions to accounting estimates.\n 1.3.10. In respect of the capital goods common for both GST and non-GST products, the GST input tax credit is taken on the eligible portion based on GST and non-GST product ratio in the month of procurement and the ineligible portion is capitalized. Subsequently, this ratio is reviewed every month as per the GST provisions and the differential GST amount arising due to changes in the ratio is capitalized beyond the materiality threshold.\n 1.3.11. The Corporation has elected to use the exemption available under Ind AS 101 to continue the carrying value for all of its Property, Plant and Equipment as recognized in the Financial Statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that as its deemed cost as at the date of transition (1\nst April 2015).\n1.4. Depreciation\n Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment are provided on the straight line basis, over the estimated \nuseful lives of assets (after retaining the estimated residual value of upto 5%). These useful lives and residual value has been determined as prescribed in the Schedule II of the Act, except in following cases:\n 1.4.1. Plant & Machinery at Retail Outlets (other than Storage tanks and related equipments) are depreciated over a useful life of 15 years based on the technical assessment.\n 1.4.2. Computer equipments are depreciated over a period of 3 years and Mobile phones are depreciated\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23255\nover a period of 2 years based on internal assessment. Electronic and electrical equipments provided \nto management staff under furniture on hire scheme are depreciated over a period of 4 years as per internal assessment. Other furniture items provided to management staff are depreciated over a period of 6 years as per internal assessment. \n 1.4.3. Solar Panels are depreciated over a period of 25 years based on the technical assessment of useful life and applicable warranty conditions.\n 1.4.4. Moulds, used for the manufacturing of the packaging material for Lubricants, are depreciated over a period of 5 years based on technical assessment of useful life.\n 1.4.5. In case of assets covered under specific agreements, e.g. assets at Railway Consumer Depots, etc., useful life is as per terms of agreement or as per Schedule II of the Act, whichever is lower.\n 1.4.6. Items of Property, Plant and Equipment costing not more than the threshold limit are depreciated at 100 percent in the year of acquisition except LPG Cylinders  and Pressure Regulators which are depreciated over a useful life of 15 years based on the technical assessment.\n 1.4.7. Components of the main asset that are significant in value and have different useful lives as compared to the main asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life. Useful life of such components has been assessed based on historical experience and internal technical assessment.\n 1.4.8. Depreciation on spare parts specific to an item of Property, Plant and Equipment is based on life of the related Property, Plant and Equipment. In other cases, the spare parts are depreciated over their estimated useful life based on the technical assessment. \n 1.4.9. Depreciation is charged on additions / deletions on pro-rata monthly basis including the month of addition / deletion.\n 1.4.10. The Residual value of LPG Cylinders (other than Composite LPG Cylinders) and Pressure Regulators have been estimated at 25% of the original cost (Previous Period: at 15% of Original Cost) based on the historical experience and internal technical assessment. The residual value of Composite LPG Cylinders is estimated at 10% of the original cost based on technical assessment.\n 1.4.11. The residual value of catalyst having precious/noble metals is estimated at the cost of the precious/noble metal content in catalyst which is expected to be extracted at end of their useful life, plus 5% of original cost of catalyst excluding cost of precious/noble metals based on the experience and internal technical assessment.\n 1.4.12. In respect of immovable assets constructed on leasehold land, useful life as per Schedule II or lease period of land (including renewable/likely renewable period) whichever is lower is considered.\n1.5. Intangible Assets\n 1.5.1. Goodwill: \n 1.5.1.1. Goodwill that arises on a business combination in accordance with Ind AS 103 \u2018Business Combinations\u2019 \nis subsequently measured net of any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually.\n 1.5.2. Other Intangible Assets\n 1.5.2.1. Intangible assets are carried at cost net of accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Expenditure on internally generated intangibles, excluding development costs, is not capitalized and is reflected in Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which such expenditure is incurred. Development costs are capitalized if, and only if, technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Corporation has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the asset and the costs can be measured reliably.\n\n1.5.2.2. Assets where entire output generated is committed to be sold to entities providing public services for almost entire useful life of the asset are classified as intangible assets as per the requirements of applicable Ind AS and are amortized (after retaining the residual value, if applicable) over their useful life or the period of the agreement, whichever is lower.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited256\n 1.5.2.3. In cases where, the Corporation has constructed assets on behalf of public infrastructure entities and \nthe Corporation has only a preferential right to use, these assets are classified as intangible assets and are amortized (after retaining the residual value, if applicable) over their useful life or the period of the agreement, whichever is lower. \n 1.5.2.4. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, such as right of way which is perpetual and absolute in nature, are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually. The useful lives are reviewed at each period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for that asset. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. The impairment losses on intangible assets with indefinite life is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.5.2.5. Expenditure incurred for creating / acquiring other intangible assets above threshold limit from which future economic benefits will flow over a period of time, is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset or five years, whichever is lower, on a straight line basis, from the time the intangible asset starts providing the economic benefit. In other cases, the expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite life are reviewed at each year end. The amortization expense on intangible asset with finite useful lives and impairment losses in case there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired, is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.5.2.6. The Corporation has elected to use the exemption available under Ind AS 101 to continue the carrying value for all of its intangible assets as recognized in the Financial Statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that as its deemed cost as at the date of transition (1\nst April 2015).\n1.6. Investment Property\n 1.6.1. Investment property is property (land or a building or part of a building or both) held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. \n 1.6.2. Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the Investment Property is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss.  \n 1.6.3. On transition to Ind AS i.e. 1\nst April 2015, the Corporation has re-classified certain items from \nProperty, Plant and Equipment to investment property.  For the same, Corporation has elected to use the exemption available under Ind AS 101 to continue the carrying value for such assets as recognized in the Financial Statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that as its deemed cost as at the date of transition (1\nst April 2015).\n1.7. Borrowing costs\n 1.7.1. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs also include exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.\n 1.7.2. Borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets (i.e. an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use) are capitalized as a part of the cost of such assets. All other borrowing costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n1.7.3. Investment Income earned on the temporary investment of funds of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n1.8. Non-current assets/Disposal Group held for sale \n 1.8.1. Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such assets.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23257\n 1.8.2. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair \nvalue less costs of disposal (upto 5% of the acquisition value)\n 1.8.3. The disposal group classified as held for sale, are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. \n 1.8.4. Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.\n1.9. Leases \nA contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset to lessee for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nCorporation shall reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease if the terms and conditions of the contract \nare changed.\n 1.9.1. As a Lessee\n  At the commencement date, corporation recognizes a right-of-use asset at cost and a lease liability at present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement date. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Corporation assesses whether: \n  - the contract involves the use of an identified asset;\n  - the Corporation has right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and; \n  - the Corporation has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n  The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability (at present value) adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives (at present value) except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Corporation recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense. Lease of items such as IT Assets (tablets, personal computers, mobiles, POS machines etc.), small items of office furniture etc. are treated as low value. \n  The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the Corporation\u2019s incremental borrowing rate computed on periodic basis based on lease term. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Corporation changes its assessment, whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. \n  Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on systematic basis and Interest on lease liability is charged to Statement of Profit and Loss as Finance cost.\n  The Corporation has elected not to apply Ind AS 116 \u201cLeases\u201d to Intangible assets. \n 1.9.2. As a Lessor\n A lessor shall classify each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease.\n 1.9.2.1. Finance leases\n  A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.\n  Corporation shall recognize assets held under a finance lease in its balance sheet and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.\n 1.9.2.2. Operating leases\n  A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.\n  Corporation shall recognize lease payments from operating leases as income on systematic basis in the pattern in which benefit from the use of the underlying asset is diminished.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited258\n1.10. Impairment of Non-financial Assets\n 1.10.1. Non-financial assets other than inventories, deferred tax assets and non-current assets classified as \nheld for sale are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Corporation estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset\u2019s or Cash-Generating Unit\u2019s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.\n 1.10.2. The carrying amount of Goodwill arising from business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n 1.10.3. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n1.11. Inventories \n 1.11.1. Inventories are stated at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower. Cost of inventories comprises \nof expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing inventories to their present location including appropriate overheads apportioned on a reasonable and consistent basis and are determined on the following basis:\n  - Crude oil, traded goods and finished products other than lubricants are determined on First in First out basis\n  - Other raw materials, packages, lubricants and stores and spares are determined on weighted average basis. \n  - The cost of Work-in-Progress is determined at raw material cost plus cost of conversion.\n 1.11.2. Customs duty on Raw materials/Finished goods lying in bonded warehouse are provided for at the applicable rates except where liability to pay duty is transferred to consignee. \n 1.11.3. Excise duty on finished stocks lying at manufacturing locations is provided for at the assessable value applicable at each of the locations based on end use. \n 1.11.4. The net realizable value of finished goods and stock in trade are based on the inter-company transfer prices and final selling prices (applicable at the location of stock) for sale to oil marketing companies and retail consumers respectively. For the purpose of stock valuation, the proportion of sales to oil marketing companies and retail consumers are determined on all India basis and considered for stock valuation at all locations. \n 1.11.5. Raw Materials held for use in the production of finished goods are not written down below cost except in cases where raw material prices have declined and it is estimated that the cost of the finished goods will exceed their net realizable value.\n 1.11.6. Obsolete, slow moving, surplus and defective stocks are identified at the time of physical verification of stocks and where necessary, provision is made for such stocks.\n1.12. Revenue Recognition\n 1.12.1. Sale of goods\n  Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the related goods to the customer. The performance obligation is considered to be satisfied when the customer obtains control of the goods. \n  Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the transaction price received or receivable (after including transaction price allocations related to arrangements involving more than one performance obligation), net of returns, taxes or duties collected on behalf of the Government and applicable trade discounts or rebates.\n  Revenue is allocated between loyalty programmes and other components of the sale. The amount allocated to the loyalty programme is deferred, and is recognized as revenue when the Corporation\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23259\nhas fulfilled its obligation to supply the products under the terms of the programme.\n  Any upfront fees earned by the Corporation with no identifiable performance obligation are recognized \nas revenue on a systematic basis over the period of the Contract. \n  Where the Corporation acts as an agent on behalf of a third party, the associated income is recognized on a net basis.\n  Claims in respect of subsidy on LPG and SKO, from Government of India are booked on in-principle acceptance thereof on the basis of available instructions / clarifications, subject to final adjustments as stipulated.\n 1.12.2. Construction contracts\n  Revenue from Construction contracts arise from the service concession arrangements entered into by the Corporation and certain arrangements involving construction of specific assets as part of arrangements involving more than one performance obligation.\n  Contract revenue includes the amount agreed in the contract to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably.\n  Based on an assessment of the terms of such contracts, the contract revenue is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss based on the percentage of completion method. \n  The stage of completion is assessed with reference to the proportion of actual cost incurred as compared to the total estimated cost of the related contract. \n  Contract expenses are recognized as incurred unless they create an asset relating to future contract activity. An expected loss on a contract is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.12.3. Interest income is recognized using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.\n 1.12.4. Dividend is recognized when right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of dividend can be measured reliably. \n 1.12.5. Income from sale of scrap is accounted for on realization. \n 1.12.6. Claims other than subsidy claims on LPG and SKO, from Government of India are booked when there is a reasonable certainty of recovery.\n1.13. Classification of Income / Expenses\n 1.13.1. Income / expenditure (net) in aggregate pertaining to prior year(s) above the threshold limit are corrected retrospectively in the first set of Financial Statements approved for issue after their discovery by restating the comparative amounts and / or restating the opening Balance Sheet for the earliest prior period presented.\n 1.13.2. Prepaid expenses upto threshold limit in each case, are charged to revenue as and when incurred.\n 1.13.3. Deposits placed with Government agencies / local authorities which are perpetual in nature are charged to revenue in the year of payment.\n1.14. Employee Benefits\n 1.14.1. Short-term employee benefits\n  Short-term employee benefits are recognized as an expense at an undiscounted amount in the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year in which the related services are rendered.\n 1.14.2. Post-employment benefits\n  Defined Contribution Plans: \n  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans such as pension are recognized as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a set-off in future payments is available.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited260\n  Defined Benefit Plans: \n  The Corporation\u2019s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans such as gratuity, other post-\nemployment benefits etc., is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that the employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. \n  The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed at each reporting period end by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit Credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Corporation, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. \n  The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss as part of employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This net interest is included in employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  Re-measurements which comprise of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)), are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. \n 1.14.3. Other long-term employee benefits\n  Liability towards other long term employee benefits - leave encashment and long service awards etc., are determined on actuarial valuation by qualified actuary by using Projected Unit Credit method. \n  The current service cost of other long terms employee benefits, recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss as part of employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the balance of the obligation. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Re-measurements are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.14.4. Termination benefits\n  Expenditure on account of Voluntary Retirement Scheme are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred.\n 1.14.5. Employee Share Based Payments\n  The Corporation recognizes Equity-settled share-based payments to employees in Statement of Profit and Loss based on estimated fair value of the options on the grant date. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Corporation\u2019s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in Other Equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Corporation revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\n  The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23261\n1.15. Foreign Currency Transactions \n 1.15.1. Monetary items:\n  Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at their respective exchange rates at the date \nthe transaction first qualifies for recognition. \n  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.\n  Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items (except for long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding as of 31\nst March 2016) are recognized in Statement of \nProfit and Loss either as profit or loss on foreign currency transaction and translation or as borrowing costs to the extent regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs. \n  The Corporation has elected to continue the policy adopted under Previous GAAP for accounting the foreign exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding as of 31\nst March 2016 i.e. foreign exchange differences arising on \nsettlement or translation of long-term foreign currency monetary items relating to acquisition of depreciable assets are adjusted to the carrying cost of the assets and depreciated over the balance life of the asset and in other cases, if any, accumulated in \u201cForeign Currency Monetary Item Translation Difference Account\u201d and amortized over the balance period of the liability.\n 1.15.2. Non - Monetary items:\n  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.\n1.16. Investment in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates \n Investments in equity shares of Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates are recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment at each reporting date.\n1.17. Government Grants\n 1.17.1. Government grants are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. \n 1.17.2. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. \n 1.17.3. Government grants relating to Property, Plant and Equipment are presented as deferred income and are credited to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the asset. \n1.18. Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Capital Commitments \n 1.18.1. Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n 1.18.2. The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of reimbursements, if any.\n 1.18.3. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n 1.18.4. Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the Corporation, or present obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. \n 1.18.5. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the Financial Statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited262\n 1.18.6. Contingent liabilities and Capital Commitments disclosed are in respect of items which in each case \nare above the threshold limit.\n1.19. Fair Value measurement\n 1.19.1. The Corporation measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each reporting date.\n 1.19.2. Certain accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. \n 1.19.3. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Corporation has access at that date. The fair value of a liability also reflects its non-performance risk. \n 1.19.4. The best estimate of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price - i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Corporation determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently that difference is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. \n 1.19.5. While measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Corporation uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation technique as follows: \n  - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n  - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) \n  - Level 3: inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) \n 1.19.6. When quoted price in active market for an instrument is available, the Corporation measures the fair value of the instrument using that price. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. \n 1.19.7. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Corporation uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. \n 1.19.8. The Corporation regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If the third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the Corporation assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. \n1.20. Financial Assets \n 1.20.1. Initial recognition and measurement\n\n1.20. Financial Assets \n 1.20.1. Initial recognition and measurement \n  Trade Receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets are initially recognized when the Corporation becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23263\n 1.20.2. Subsequent measurement \n  Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial \nassets. Based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset, the Corporation classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through Other Comprehensive Income or fair value through profit or loss.\n  Debt instruments at amortized cost \n  A \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is \n  - To hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and \n  - Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments \nof principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n  After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n  If there is revision in estimates of receipts/contractual cash flows, gross carrying amount of the financial assets are recalculated at period end as the present value of the estimated future contractual \ncash flows that are discounted at the financial asset\u2019s original effective interest rate due to revision in \nestimates of receipts. Adjustment, if any, is recognised as income or expense in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  Debt instruments at Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)\n  A \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the fair value through Other Comprehensive Income if both the \nfollowing conditions are met:\n  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both\n  - collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and\n  - contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding.\n  After initial measurement, these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income under Effective Interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. \n  Debt instruments at Fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \n  Fair Value through Profit or Loss is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, \nwhich does not meet the criteria for categorization at amortized cost or as FVOCI, is classified as FVTPL.\n  After initial measurement, any fair value changes including any interest income, foreign exchange gain and losses, impairment losses and other net gains and losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss separately.\n  Equity investments \n  All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Such equity \ninstruments which are held for trading are classified as FVTPL. For all other such equity instruments, the Corporation decides to classify the same either as FVOCI or FVTPL. The Corporation makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited264\n  For equity instruments classified as FVOCI, all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, \nare recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Dividends on such equity instruments are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.20.3. De-recognition \n  A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e. removed from the Corporation\u2019s Balance Sheet) when:\n  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or \n  The Corporation has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass-through\u2019 arrangement; and either:\n  - The Corporation has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or \n  - The Corporation has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n  On de-recognition, any gains or losses on all debt instruments (other than debt instruments measured at FVOCI) and equity instruments (measured at FVTPL) are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Gains and losses in respect of debt instruments measured at FVOCI and that are accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss on de-recognition. Gains or losses on equity instruments \nmeasured at FVOCI that are recognized and accumulated in OCI are not reclassified to profit or loss on \nde-recognition. \n 1.20.4. Impairment of financial assets \n  In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Corporation applies Expected Credit Loss (\u201cECL\u201d) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the financial assets measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at FVOCI. \n  Loss allowances on receivables from customers are measured following the \u2018simplified approach\u2019 at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL at each reporting date. In respect of other financial assets such as loan to LPG Consumers, debt securities and bank balances, the loss allowance is measured at 12 month ECL only if there is no significant deterioration in the credit risk since initial recognition of the asset or asset is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date.\n1.21. Financial Liabilities\n 1.21.1. Initial recognition and measurement\n  Financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Corporation becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n  Financial liability is initially measured at fair value minus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.\n 1.21.2. Subsequent measurement \n  Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial liabilities.\n  Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \n  A financial liability is classified as at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) if it is classified as held-for-trading or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest expense, are recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23265\n  Financial Liabilities at amortized cost\n  After initial recognition, financial liabilities other than those which are classified as FVTPL are \nsubsequently measured at amortized cost using the Effective Interest Rate (\u201cEIR\u201d) method. \n  Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortization done using the EIR method is included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n 1.21.3. De-recognition \n  A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n1.22. Financial guarantees\n Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Corporation are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as \nper impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the fair value initially recognized less cumulative amortization. \n1.23. Derivative financial instruments \n The Corporation uses derivative financial instruments to manage the commodity price risk and exposure on \naccount of fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value with the changes being recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n The fair valuation gains or losses on foreign currency derivatives measured at FVTPL are grouped along with Gain or loss on foreign currency transactions and translations and presented under \u201cOther Income\u201d or \u201cOther expenses\u201d, as the case may be, since these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective and may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109.\n1.24. Embedded derivatives \n If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset within the scope of Ind AS 109, the classification requirements contained in Ind AS 109 are applied to the entire hybrid contract. Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts, including financial liabilities are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not held for trading or designated at fair value through profit and loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss, unless designated as effective hedging instruments. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. \n1.25. Offsetting of financial instruments \n Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited266\n1.26. Taxes on Income\n 1.26.1. Current Tax\n  Income-tax Assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting period.\n  Current Tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in the Statement of Profit and Loss, Other Comprehensive income or directly in equity. \n 1.26.2. Deferred tax\n  Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.\n  Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences.\n  Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.\n  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n  Deferred Tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in the Statement of Profit and Loss, Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity. \n  Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n1.27. Earnings per share\n 1.27.1. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividends, if any, and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.\n 1.27.2. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n1.28. Classification of Assets and Liabilities as Current and Non-Current:\n All assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current as per the Corporation\u2019s normal operating cycle (considered as 12 months) and other criteria set out in Schedule III of the Act.\n1.29. Cash and Cash equivalents\n Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet include cash at bank, cash, cheque, draft on hand and demand deposits with an original maturity of less than three months, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. \n For the purpose of Statement of Cash Flows, Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, cash, cheques and drafts on hand, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Corporation\u2019s cash management. The Corporation considers all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23267\ndate of purchase of three months or less and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash \nequivalents.\n1.30. Cash Flows\n Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are segregated. \n1.31. Business Combinations of entities under common control \n Business combinations involving entities that are ultimately controlled by the same party(ies) before and after the business combination are considered as common control entities and are accounted using the pooling of interest method as follows:\n - The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts. \n - No adjustments are made to reflect the fair values, or recognise new assets or liabilities. Adjustments are made to harmonise accounting policies.\n - The financial information in the Financial Statements in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business combination has occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the Financial Statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. However, if business combination had occurred after that date, the prior period information shall be restated only from that date.\n The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the Financial Statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the Financial Statements of the transferee or is adjusted against general reserve.\n The identity of the reserves are preserved and the reserves of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee.\n The difference if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.\n1.32.

As a recognition of contribution of employees in growth of the Corporation and increase in shareholders\u2019 value, the Scheme as a primary objective seeks to reward eligible employees for their loyalty/longevity with the Corporation. The Scheme also covered the employees who had opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) during FY 2020-21.\n As per Vesting Condition of the Scheme, the employee had to render services till the date of share transfer or retirement (including VRS) or Death in Service whichever is earlier. In view of the above, the Scheme was accounted as Employee Stock Option Scheme, in line with the applicable Ind AS. \n Each option converted into one equity share of the Corporation upon exercise. No amounts were paid or payable by the recipient on receipt of the option. The options carried neither rights to dividends nor voting rights. These options were vested and exercised on 20\nth April 2021. All options which remained unexercised \nduring FY 2021-22 have lapsed.\n The share-based payments (options) to employees being equity-settled instruments were measured at the fair value of the equity instruments of the Corporation at the grant date. The fair value determined at the grant \ndate of the equity-settled share-based payments was expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, \nbased on the Corporation\u2019s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in Total Equity.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23319\nNOTE 55 SHARE BASED PAYMENT (CONTD.)\n(b) Movement during the period\nThe number and Weighted Average Exercise Prices (WAEP) of the options and movement during the period is \nas follows:\nParticulars 2022-23 2021-22\nNumber of \noptionsWAEP (in `) Number of options WAEP (in `)\nOpening balance  -    -    3,96,36,732  126.54 \nGranted during the period  -    -    -    -   \nExercised during the period  -    -    (3,65,42,077)  126.54 \nForfeited during the period  -    -    (37,175)  126.54 \nExpired during the period  -    -    (30,57,480)  126.54 \nClosing balance  -    -    -    -   \nExercisable at period end  -    -    -    -   \n(c) Fair value of options granted\nThe model inputs used in the measurement of grant date fair value are as follows:\nParticulars BPCL ESPS Scheme 2020\nOption pricing model used Black Scholes Merton formula\nFair Value of options on Grant Date `235.77\nShare Price on Grant Date `385.15\nExercise price `126.54\nDividend Yield 6.13%\nExpected Volatility* 45.00%\nRisk free interest rate 3.63%\nExpected life of share options 0.56 Years\n* The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of the share price.\n(d) Expense arising from share based payment transactions\nTotal expense arising from share based payment transactions for FY 2022\u201323 is NIL (Previous year : ` 77.06 \nCrores). The same is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss as an exceptional item.\nNOTE 56 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS\nThe Corporation assesses at each reporting date, whether there is an indication for impairment of assets. The Corporation takes into consideration external and internal sources of information available about the asset to check whether any indication for impairment exists. If any such indication exists, the Corporation estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. The value in use is assessed based on the estimated future cash flows which are discounted to their present value using the discount rate that reflects the time value of money and risk specific to the assets for which the future cash flows estimates have not been adjusted. An impairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent asset\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.\nBased on the assessment, there is no indication of impairment of assets except for the Corporation\u2019s investment in \nsubsidiary company Bharat PetroResources Limited (BPRL). The gross carrying value of investment in BPRL as of 31\nst March 2023 is  ` 9,601.37 Crores. BPRL is an upstream company and is having investments in Oil and Gas Blocks \nglobally and in India, either directly or through its Subsidiaries (including step down Subsidiaries), Joint ventures and Associates. During the current financial year, BPRL has impaired investments in its subsidiary company due to change in prospects of its blocks. Accordingly, impairment testing was carried out on equity investment made by the Corporation in BPRL and an impairment loss of ` 1,359.96 Crores has been recognized based on the value in \nuse of assets as on 31\nst March 2023. Such impairment loss is shown as an exceptional item in Statement of Profit \nand Loss for the year ended 31st March 2023. The accumulated impairment loss on investments in BPRL as of 31st \nMarch 2023 is ` 3,392.75 Crores.\nDuring the previous year, an impairment provision of `14.08 Crores was created on investment in one of the \nassociate companies [GSPL India Transco Limited], which is shown under other expenses.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited320\nNOTE 57 PROVISION\nIn compliance of Ind AS 37 on \u201cProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\u201d, the required information \nis as under:\n`in Crores\nNature Opening \nbalanceAdditions \nduring the yearUtilisation  \nduring the yearReversals \nduring the yearClosing \nbalance\nExcise  0.62  205.23  -    -    205.85 \nCustoms  3.24  -    -    -    3.24 \nService Tax  -    0.90  -    -    0.90 \nVAT/ Sales Tax/ Entry Tax/GST  294.06  148.88  146.63  18.40  277.91 \nProperty Tax  73.60  24.36  8.72  6.52  82.72 \nTotal  371.52  379.37  155.35  24.92  570.62 \nPrevious year  484.26  42.69  91.84  63.59  371.52 \nThe above provisions are made based on estimates and the expected timing of outflows is not ascertainable at this stage.\nAbove includes provision of  ` 90.19 Crores (Previous year: ` 94.39  Crores) for which deposits have been made.\nNOTE 58 DISCLOSURE IN RESPECT OF EXPENDITURE ON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \nACTIVITIES  \n`in Crores\nParticulars 2022-23 2021-22\na) Unspent CSR Expenditure carried forward from previous year (Opening Provision)@ 45.96  17.01 \nb) Amount required to be spent by the Corporation during the year  190.95  166.73 \nc) Surplus arising out of the CSR projects/programs or activities  0.68  -   \nd) Amount spent during the year (on purposes other than construction / acquisition of \nassets controlled by the Corporation)*# 128.67  137.78 \ne) Shortfall at the end of the year (Closing Provision) (a + b + c - d) ^  108.92  45.96 \n*The above expenditure includes contribution to funds, expenses through registered trusts / registered society, company established under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013 and direct expenses towards implementation of CSR activities by the Corporation.

Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Corporation if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group\u2019s trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances, derivatives and debt securities. The maximum exposure to credit risk in case of all the financial instruments covered below is restricted to their respective carrying amount.\n(a) Trade and other receivables from customers\n Credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit \nlimits and monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to whom the Corporation grants credit terms in the normal course of business.\n As at 31\nst March 2023 and 31st March 2022, the Corporation\u2019s retail dealers, industrial and aviation customers \naccounted for the majority of the trade receivables.\n Expected credit loss assessment for Trade and other receivables from customers as at 31st March 2023 and 31st  March 2022\n The Corporation uses an allowance matrix to measure the expected credit losses of trade and other receivables.  \nThe loss rates are computed using a \u2018Roll Rate\u2019 method based on the probability of receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write off. Roll rates are calculated separately for exposures in different segments based on the following common credit risk characteristics - type of product purchases, type of customers.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23325\nNOTE 59 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTD.)\nThe following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and Expected Credit Loss Allowance for \ntrade and other receivables:\n`in Crores\nAs at 31st March 2023Gross carrying \namountWeighted average \nloss rate - rangeLoss allowance\nDebts not due  4,372.52 0.38%  16.66 \nDebts over due  2,043.26 18.44%  376.85 \nTOTAL  6,415.78 6.13%  393.51 \n`in Crores\nAs at 31st March 2022Gross carrying \namountWeighted average \nloss rate - rangeLoss allowance\nDebts not due  6,126.49 0.20%  12.25 \nDebts over due  2,990.31 11.15%  333.47 \nTOTAL  9,116.80 3.79%  345.72 \nThe Corporation does not provide for any loss allowance on trade receivables where risk of default is negligible such as receivables from other oil marketing companies, if any, hence the same is excluded from above.  \nLoss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over the past three years.\nThe movement in the loss allowance in respect of trade and other receivables during the year was as follows.\n`in Crores\nParticular Amount\nBalance as at 1st April, 2021  443.64 \nMovement during the year  (97.92)\nBalance as at 31st March, 2022  345.72 \nMovement during the year  47.79 \nBalance as at 31st March, 2023  393.51 \n(b) PMUY and Other Loans\n As per the Government of India\u2019s scheme \u2013 Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the Corporation has given interest \nfree loans to PMUY customers towards cost of hot plate and 1st refill, which is to be recovered from the subsidy \namount payable to customer when such customers book refill. During the year, the Corporation has recalculated gross carrying amount of the loans at period end at the present value of the estimated future contractual cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate due to revision in estimates of receipts based on projections of subsidy amount per refill. Accordingly, the gross carrying amount of the loans has been reduced by `5.24 Crores \n(Previous year: ` 367.29 Crores) with a corresponding recognition of expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  \nThe Corporation assesses the credit risks / significant increases in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. For determining the expected credit loss on such loans, the Corporation considers the time elapsed since the last refill for determining probability of default on collective basis. Accordingly, the expected credit loss of ` 128.07 Crores (Previous year: ` 88.15 Crores) has been recognized on carrying amount of \n`577.12 Crores (Previous year: ` 642.56 Crores) of PMUY Loans. (Refer Note No. 9 and 18)\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited326\nNOTE 59 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTD.)\nThe movement in the loss allowance in respect of PMUY and other loans during the year was as follows. \n`in Crores\nParticular Amount\nBalance as at 1st April, 2021  87.93 \nMovement during the year  1.85 \nBalance as at 31st March, 2022  89.78 \nMovement during the year  40.09 \nBalance as at 31st  March, 2023  129.87 \n(c) Cash and cash equivalents and Other Bank Balances\n The Corporation held cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances of  `2,120.44 Crores at 31st March \n2023 (Previous year:  ` 1,450.90 Crores). The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank / financial institution \ncounterparties have good credit ratings/ good market standing. Also, Corporation invests its short term surplus \nfunds in bank fixed deposits, Tri Party Repo etc., which carry lesser mark to market risks for short duration.\n(d) Derivatives\n The derivatives are entered into with banks, financial institutions and other counterparties with good credit \nratings. Further exposures to counter\u2013parties are closely monitored and kept within the approved limits. \n(e) Investment in debt securities\n Investment in debt instruments mainly include loans to subsidiary, joint venture companies, investment in government securities and debt schemes of mutual fund which do not carry any significant credit risk.\nC.iii. Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Corporation will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its \nfinancial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. \nLiquidity risk is managed by Corporation through effective fund management. The Corporation has obtained fund \nand non\u2013fund based working capital lines from various banks. Furthermore, the Corporation has access to funds from debt markets through Commercial Paper programs, Foreign Currency Borrowings and other debt instruments.\nThe following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are \ngross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments;\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23327\nNOTE 59 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTD.)\nMaturity Analysis of Significant Financial Liabilities\n`in Crores\nAs at 31st March 2023Contractual cash flows\nTotal Upto 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 yearsMore than 5 \nyears\nNon-derivative financial liabilities \nBondsTerm loansNon Convertible DebenturesLong Term Loans (Foreign Currency)Lease Liabilities Short term borrowingsShort term borrowings (Foreign Currency)Trade payablesOther financial liabilitiesFinancial guarantee contracts * 4,521.93 \n 14,493.79 \n 7,364.02  6,517.91 \n 17,390.09 \n 3,754.94  3,412.00 \n \n24,010.84 \n 21,086.99  15,348.88  164.43 \n 1,526.26  2,859.12  6,517.91  1,262.66  3,754.94  3,412.00 \n 24,010.84  21,086.99 \n -    4,357.50 \n 11,473.99 \n 3,442.20 \n -   \n 1,809.12 \n -    -   \n -   \n -   \n 2,794.55   -   \n 883.54 \n 1,062.70 \n -   \n 1,809.16 \n -    -   \n -   \n -   \n 12,270.87  -   \n 610.00 \n -    -   \n 12,509.15 \n -    -   \n -   \n -   \n 283.46  \n`in Crores\nAs at 31st March 2022Contractual cash flows\nTotal Upto 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 yearsMore than 5 \nyears\nNon-derivative financial liabilities\nBondsTerm loansNon Convertible DebenturesLong Term Loans (Foreign Currency)Lease Liabilities Short term borrowingsTrade payables\nOther financial liabilities\nFinancial guarantee contracts * 8,286.66 \n 7,278.36  7,307.07  6,210.27 \n 16,168.06 \n 7,593.36 \n 30,330.11 \n 20,589.14 \n 7,437.25  4,117.27 \n 775.35 \n 1,155.88 \n 153.36 \n 1,159.83 \n 7,593.36 \n 30,330.11 \n 20,589.14 \n 741.77  303.23 \n 4,843.38 \n 2,934.80  5,922.20  1,906.72 \n -    -   \n -   \n -    3,866.16 \n 1,301.87  3,216.39 \n 110.58 \n 1,687.65 \n -    -   \n -   \n 6,434.13  -\n-   \n 357.76 \n 24.13 \n 11,413.86 \n -   \n -   \n -   \n 261.35\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited328\nNOTE 59 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTD.)\n*These Guarantees have been issued by the Corporation in favour of lenders of subsidiaries with respect to \nborrowings raised by the respective entities. \nThe above also includes guarantee amount of ` 283.45 Crores (equivalent USD 34.48 Million) [ Previous Year `261.35 \nCrores (equivalent USD 34.48 Million)] towards BPRL Venture Mozambique BV\u2019s pro rata share of drawdown of \nUSD 28.73 Million (as on 31st March 2023) [USD 28.73 Million (as on 31st March 2022)] under the project finance \narrangement entered into for 2-train 12.88 MMTPA LNG Project in Mozambique Offshore Area 1, Rovuma basin. This project is being partly funded through project finance under which an amount of USD 15.4 Billion has already been finalised. BPCL has provided a Debt Service Undertaking (DSU) to guarantee its pro rata share (i.e. towards BPRL Venture Mozambique BV\u2019s Participating Interest (PI) of 10% in the project) of project finance obligations to any project finance beneficiaries under project financing arrangement, capped at a maximum of USD 1.92 Billion (out of which the draw down was USD 28.73 Million as at 31\nst March 2023) (Draw down was USD 28.73 Million as at 31st March 2022). \nThese guarantee amounts will be payable on default by the concerned entity. As of the reporting date, none of the subsidiaries have defaulted and hence, the Corporation does not have any present obligation to third parties in relation to such guarantees. The bifurcation of contractual cash flows in different years is based on expiry of said guarantees.\nC.iv. Market risk\nMarket Risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of \nchanges in market prices. Market risk comprises four types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity risk and other price risk.\nC.iv.a Currency risk\nThe Corporation is exposed to currency risk on account of its operating and financing activities. The functional \ncurrency of the Corporation is Indian Rupee. Our exposure is mainly denominated in US Dollars (USD). The USD exchange rate has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.  \nThe Corporation has put in place a Financial Risk Management Policy to identify the most effective and efficient ways of managing the currency risks. The Corporation uses derivative instruments, (mainly foreign exchange forward contracts) to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in line with the policy.\nThe Corporation does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nExposure to currency risk\nThe currency profile in INR of foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31\nst March \n2023 and  31st March 2022 are as below:\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23329\nNOTE 59 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTD.)\n`in Crores\nAs at 31st March 2023 USD EURO JPY CHF Others\nFinancial assets \nCash and cash equivalents  31.56  -    -    -    -   \nTrade receivables and Other Financial assets  1,059.75  -    -    -    0.01 \nNet exposure for assets  1,091.31  -    -    -    0.01 \nFinancial liabilities  \nBonds  4,100.75  -    -    -    -   \nLong Term Loans (Foreign Currency)  6,160.00  -    -    -    -   \nShort term borrowings (including Foreign Currency loans)  3,412.00  -    -    -    -   \nTrade Payables and other financial liabilities  12,445.95  31.52  13.27  0.00  0.63 \nAdd/(Less): Foreign currency forward exchange contracts  (1,031.91)  -    -    -    -   \nNet exposure for liabilities  25,086.79  31.52  13.27  0.00  0.63 \nNet exposure (Assets - Liabilities)  (23,995.47)  (31.52)  (13.27)  (0.00)  (0.62)\n`in Crores\nAs at 31st March 2022 USD EURO JPY CHF Others\nFinancial assets Cash and cash equivalents  23.85  -    -    -    -   \nTrade receivables and other assets  3,127.66  -    -    -    0.02 \n 3,151.51  -    -    -    0.02 \nFinancial liabilities  \nBonds  7,566.61  -    -    -    -   \nLong Term Loans (Foreign Currency)  6,013.11  -    -    -    -   \nTrade Payables and other liabilities  22,231.06  36.63  16.58  0.16  5.26 \nAdd/(Less): Foreign curency forward exchange contracts  (1,856.17)  -    -    -    -   \nNet exposure for liabilities  33,954.61  36.63  16.58  0.16  5.26 \nNet exposure (Assets - Liabilities)  (30,803.10)  (36.63)  (16.58)  (0.16)  (5.24)\nSensitivity analysis\nA reasonably possible strengthening/ (weakening) of the USD against INR at 31\nst March would have affected the \nmeasurement of financial instruments denominated in US dollars and affected profit or loss (before tax) by the \namounts shown below.

In cases where the related foreign exchange fluctuation is capitalised to Property, Plant and Equipment or recognised directly in reserves,  the impact indicated below may affect the Corporation\u2019s income statement over the remaining life of the related Property, Plant and Equipment or the remaining tenure of the borrowing respectively.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited330\nNOTE 59 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTD.)\n`in Crores\nEffect in INR (before tax)\nFor the year ended 31st March, 2023Profit or loss\nStrengthening Weakening\n3% movement \nUSD  (719.86)  719.86 \n (719.86)  719.86 \n`in Crores\nEffect in INR (before tax)\nFor the year ended 31st March, 2022Profit or loss\nStrengthening Weakening\n3% movement \nUSD  (924.09)  924.09 \n (924.09)  924.09 \nC.iv.b Interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest rate risk is \nthe risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing financial instruments because of fluctuations in the interest rates, in cases where the  instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest bearing instruments will fluctuate because of fluctuations in the interest rates. \nThe Corporation\u2019s approach to managing interest rate risk is to have a judicious mix of borrowed funds with fixed \nand floating interest rate obligation.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23331\nNOTE 59 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTD.)\nExposure to interest rate risk\nCorporation\u2019s interest rate risk arises primarily from borrowings.

Accordingly, a decrease in 25 basis points in interest rates is likely to increase the profit or loss (before tax)  for the year ending 31\nst March 2023 by ` 19.26 Crores (Previous \nyear: `29.43 Crores) and an increase in 25 basis points in interest rates is likely to decrease the profit or loss (before \ntax)  for the year ending 31st March 2023 by ` 19.14 Crores (Previous year: ` 29.18 Crores).\nCash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments\nA reasonably possible change of 25 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased \n(decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.

Prices of both are set by markets. Hence Corporation uses derivatives instruments (swaps, futures, options and forwards) to hedge exposures to commodity price risk to cover refinery operating cost using Basic Swaps on various products\u2019 cracks like Naphtha, Gasoline (Petrol), Jet/Kerosene, Gasoil (Diesel) and Fuel Oil against Benchmark Dubai Crude. Further volatility in freight costs is hedged through Freight Forwards and bunker purchases. Settlement of all derivative transactions take place on the basis of monthly average of the daily prices of the settlement month quoted by Platts. \nCorporation measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions using value-at-risk (VaR) techniques. \nThese techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding period.\nCorporation uses historical model of VaR techniques based on variance/covariance to make a statistical assessment \nof the market risk arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period and within a 95% confidence level. The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account positions and the history of price movements for last two years. Since there are no open positions as on 31\nst  March 2023 VAR for open \nposition as on 31st March 2023 is NIL.\nC.iv.d Price risk\nThe Corporation\u2019s exposure to equity investments\u2019 price risk arises from investments held by the Corporation and \nclassified in the financial statements at fair value through OCI.

However, since physical verification at certain locations was not possible for us, in such cases we have relied on the physical verification of inventory carried out by the Management.\n\u2022 In respect of the Corporation\u2019s inventory lying with third parties, we have ascertained that these have substantially been confirmed by them.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements \nas a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors\u2019 report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.\n20.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group, joint ventures and its associates to cease to continue as a going concern.\n \u2022 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n \u2022 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors\u2019 report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23351\nReport on other legal and Regulatory Requirements\n25.

Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion \non the internal financial controls system over financial reporting of the Holding Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, which are companies incorporated in India.\nMeaning of internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nA Corporation\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance \nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Corporation\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions \nand dispositions of the assets of the Corporation;\n 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Corporation; and\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23355\n 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the Corporation\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.\ninherent limitations of internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of \ncollusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nopinion\nIn our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Holding Company and \nits subsidiaries, Joint ventures and associates, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, except for the matter stated in Other Matter Paragraph, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.\nother Matters\n1) \u2018Hello-BPCL\u2019 Application:\n a) Certain weaknesses in the Application \u2018Hello-BPCL\u2019 with respect to \u2018Advanced Loyalty Programme\u2019(ALP) which \nwere exploited by certain fleet card customers by fraudulently taking undue advantage and utilised certain ineligible recharges credited to their wallets without payment being received from customers (Refer Para 26 of our Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements in relation to Fraud Reporting) and; \n b) Deficiency in the process of reconciliation of amounts received from customers through the payment aggregators.\n  Management has informed us that they have taken steps to fix these weaknesses.\n  Our Opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter.\nWe have considered the above in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the March 31, 2023. The above (as explained in Note 43 of the Consolidated financial statements) is not likely to affect our opinion on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements of the Corporation.\n2) Our aforesaid reports under section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the \ninternal financial controls over financial reporting in so far as it relates to one subsidiary, four associates and eight joint ventures which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports issued by auditors of such companies, which do not disclose any material inadequacy in the internal financial controls over financial reporting.\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of the above matters.\nFor Kalyaniwalla & Mistry llP For K. s. aiyar & Co\nChartered Accountants Chartered Accountants\nICAI FRN: 104607W/W100166 ICAI FRN: 100186W\nSd/- Sd/-\nsai Venkata Ramana damarla  Rajesh s.

Ltd., FINO Paytech Limited and BPCL-KIAL Fuel Farm Private Limited are yet to be audited and hence provisional Financial Statements provided by management of the respective companies have been considered for the purpose of preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements. \n1.2. Basis of consolidatio n \n 1.2.1. subsidiaries\n  Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Corporation. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those which significantly affect the entity\u2019s returns. The Financial Statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which the control ceases.\n  Subsidiaries are consolidated by combining like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. The intra-company balances and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These consolidated Financial Statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Corporation. Non-controlling interests (\u201cNCI\u201d) which represent part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the company, are excluded.\n  Changes in the Corporation\u2019s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n 1.2.2. Joint Venture and associates\n  A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Corporation has joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than the rights to its assets and obligation for its liabilities. An associate is an entity in which the Corporation has significant influence, but no control or joint control over the financial and operating policies.\n  Interest in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognized at cost which includes transaction cost. Subsequent to initial recognition the consolidated Financial Statements include the JVCs and associates share of profit or loss and Other Comprehensive Income (\u201cOCI\u201d) of such entities until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.\n  Unrealised gains / losses arising from transactions with such entities are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Corporation\u2019s interest in the investee.\n 1.2.3. Business Combinations\n  In accordance with Ind AS 101 First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards, the Group has\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited368\nelected to apply the requirements of Ind AS 103, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d prospectively to business \ncombinations on or after the date of transition (1st April 2015). Pursuant to this exemption, goodwill / \ncapital reserve arising from business combination has been stated at the carrying amount under Previous GAAP. In accordance with Ind AS 103, the Group accounts for these business combinations using the acquisition method when the control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred for the business combinations is generally measured at fair value as at the date the control is acquired (acquisition date), of the net identifiable assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. \n  If a business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in Profit or Loss or OCI as appropriate.\n  Common Control \n  Business combinations involving entities that are ultimately controlled by the same party(ies) before and after the business combination are considered as Common control entities and are accounted using the pooling of interest method as follows:\n  -  The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts.\n  - No adjustments are made to reflect the fair values, or recognise new assets or liabilities. Adjustments are made to harmonise accounting policies.\n  - The financial information in the Financial Statements in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business combination has occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the Financial Statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. However, if business combination had occurred after that date, the prior period information shall be restated only from that date.\n  The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the Financial Statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the Financial Statements of the transferee or is adjusted against general reserve.\n  The identity of the reserves are preserved and the reserves of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee.\n  The difference if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.\n1.3. Use of Judgements and e stimates\n The preparation of the consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and the accompanying disclosures along with contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require material adjustments to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. The Group continually evaluates these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information.\n In particular, information about significant areas of estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated Financial Statements are as below:\n \u2022 Assessment of functional currency;\n \u2022 Financial instruments;\n \u2022 Estimates of useful lives and residual value of Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets;\n \u2022 Valuation of inventories;\n \u2022 Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23369\n \u2022 Measurement of Defined Benefit Obligations and actuarial assumptions;\n \u2022 Provisions including loss allowances;\n \u2022 Evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets; \n \u2022 Contingencies;\n \u2022 Interest in Joint arrangements; and\n \u2022 In case of BPRL, impairment of exploration and evaluation assets; key assumptions for underlying recoverable \namounts, and \n \u2022 Estimation of Oil and Natural Gas reserves:\n - The determination of the Group\u2019s estimated oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact the determination of the Group\u2019s estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. The Group estimates its proved reserves with a reasonable certainty on the basis of rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n - Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization charges for the Group\u2019s oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the consolidated financial statements. If proved reserves estimates are revised downwards, retained earnings could be affected by changes in depreciation expense or an immediate write-down of the property\u2019s carrying value.\n Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized prospectively in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n1.4. Property, plant and equipment \n 1.4.1. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. \n 1.4.2. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost (including import duties and non-refundable taxes), any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if any, and, borrowing cost for qualifying assets (i.e. assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use).\n 1.4.3. Direct expenses incurred during construction period on capital projects are capitalized. Other expenses of the project group which are allocated to projects costing above the threshold limits are also capitalized. Expenditure incurred on enabling assets are capitalised. \n 1.4.4. Gas distribution systems is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment when it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. \n 1.4.5. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the group.\n 1.4.6. Expenditure on assets, other than plant and machinery, LPG cylinders and pressure regulators, not exceeding the threshold limits are charged to revenue.\n 1.4.7. Spare parts which meet the definition of Property, Plant and Equipment are capitalized as Property, Plant and Equipment in case the unit value of the spare part is above the threshold limits. In other cases, the spare part is inventorized on procurement and charged to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on consumption.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited370\n 1.4.8. An item of Property, Plant and Equipment and any significant part initially recognized separately as part \nof Property, Plant and Equipment is derecognized upon disposal; or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.\n 1.4.9. The residual values and useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and changes, if any, are accounted in the line with revisions to accounting estimates.\n 1.4.10. In respect of the capital goods common for both GST and non-GST products, the GST input tax credit is taken on the eligible portion based on GST and non-GST product ratio in the month of procurement and the ineligible portion is capitalised. Subsequently, this ratio is reviewed every month as per the GST provisions and the differential GST amount arising due to changes in the ratio is capitalised beyond the materiality threshold.\n 1.4.11. The Group has elected to use the exemption available under Ind AS 101 to continue the carrying value for all of its Property, Plant and Equipment as recognized in the Financial Statements as at the date of transition to Ind ASs, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that as its deemed cost as at the date of transition (1\nst April 2015).\n1.5. depreciation\n Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment are provided on the straight line basis, over the estimated useful \nlives of assets (after retaining the estimated residual value of upto 5%). These useful lives and residual value has been determined as prescribed in the Schedule II of the Act, except in following cases:  \n 1.5.1. Plant & Machinery at Retail Outlets (other than Storage tanks and related equipments) are depreciated over a useful life of 15 years based on the technical assessment.\n 1.5.2. Computer equipments are depreciated over a period of 3 years and Mobile phones are depreciated over a period of 2 years based on internal assessment. Electronic and electrical equipments provided to management staff under furniture on hire scheme are depreciated over a period of 4 years as per internal assessment.  Other furniture items provided to management staff are depreciated over a period of 6 years as per internal assessment.\n 1.5.3. Solar Panels are depreciated over a period of 25 years based on the technical assessment of useful life and applicable warranty conditions.\n 1.5.4. Moulds, used for the manufacturing of the packaging material for Lubricants, are depreciated over a period of 5 years based on technical assessment of useful life.\n 1.5.5. In case of assets covered under specific agreements, e.g. assets at Railway Consumer Depots, etc., useful life is as per terms of agreement or as per Schedule II of the Act, whichever is lower.\n 1.5.6. Items of Property, Plant and Equipment costing not more than the threshold limits are depreciated at 100 percent in the year of acquisition except LPG Cylinders and Pressure Regulators which are depreciated over a useful life of 15 years based on the technical assessment. \n 1.5.7. In case of BPRL, workstations are depreciated over a period of 5 years. The useful lives are estimated based on the internal assessment.\n 1.5.8. Components of the main asset that are significant in value and have different useful lives as compared to the main asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life. Useful life of such components has been assessed based on historical experience and internal technical assessment.\n 1.5.9. Depreciation on spare parts specific to an item of Property, Plant and Equipment is based on life of the related Property, Plant and Equipment. In other cases, the spare parts are depreciated over their estimated useful life based on the technical assessment.\n\n1.5.10. Depreciation is charged on additions / deletions on pro-rata monthly basis including the month of addition / deletion.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23371\n 1.5.11. The Residual value of LPG cylinders (other than Composite LPG Cylinders) and Pressure Regulators \nhave been estimated at 25% of the original cost (Previous Period: at 15% of Original Cost) based on the historical experience and internal technical assessment. The residual value of Composite LPG Cylinders is estimated at 10% of the original cost based on technical assessment.\n 1.5.12. The residual value of catalyst having precious/noble metals is estimated at the cost of the precious/noble metal content in catalyst which is expected to be extracted at end of their useful life, plus 5% of original cost of catalyst excluding cost of precious/noble metals based on the experience and internal technical assessment.\n 1.5.13. In respect of immovable assets constructed on leasehold land, useful life as per Schedule II or lease period of land (including renewable/likely renewable period) whichever is lower is considered.\n1.6. intangible assets\n 1.6.1. Goodwill: \n  1.6.1.1. Goodwill that arises on a business combination is subsequently measured at net of any \naccumulated impairment losses.\n  1.6.1.2. In respect of business combinations that occurred prior to 1\nst April 2015, goodwill is included \non the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under Previous GAAP, adjusted for the reclassification of certain intangibles.\n  1.6.1.3. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually.\n 1.6.2. other intangible assets\n  1.6.2.1. Intangible assets are carried at cost net of accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Expenditure on internally generated intangibles, excluding development costs, is not capitalized and is reflected in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which such expenditure is incurred. Development costs are capitalized if, and only if, technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the asset and the costs can be measured reliably.\n  1.6.2.2. Assets where entire output generated is committed to be sold to entities providing public services for almost entire useful life of the asset are classified as intangible assets as per the requirements of Applicable Ind AS  and are amortized (after retaining the residual value, if applicable) over their useful life or the period of the agreement, whichever is lower. \n  1.6.2.3. In cases where, the Corporation or its Subsidiaries has constructed assets on behalf of public infrastructure entities and it has only a preferential right to use, these assets are classified as intangible assets and are amortized (after retaining the residual value, if applicable) over their useful life or the period of the agreement, whichever is lower. \n  1.6.2.4. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, such as right of way which is perpetual and absolute in nature, are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually. The useful lives are reviewed at each period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for that asset. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. The impairment losses on intangible assets with indefinite life are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n1.6.2.5. Expenditure incurred for creating / acquiring other intangible assets above threshold limits from which future economic benefits will flow over a period of time, is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset or five years, whichever is lower, on a straight line basis, from the time the intangible asset starts providing the economic benefit. In other cases, the expenditure is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited372\nfinite life are reviewed at each year end. The amortization expense on intangible asset with finite \nuseful lives and impairment losses in case there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  1.6.2.6. The Group has elected to use the exemption available under Ind AS 101 to continue the carrying value for all of its intangible assets as recognized in the Financial Statements as at the date of transition to Ind ASs, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that as its deemed cost as at the date of transition (1\nst April 2015).\n1.7. investment Property\n 1.7.1. Investment property is property (land or a building or part of a building or both) held either to earn \nrental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.  Investment properties are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. \n 1.7.2. Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the Investment Property is recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.  \n 1.7.3. On transition to Ind AS i.e. 1\nst April 2015, the Group has re-classified certain items from Property, \nPlant and Equipment to investment property.  For the same, Group has elected to use the exemption available under Ind AS 101 to continue the carrying value for such assets as recognized in the Financial Statements as at the date of transition to Ind ASs, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that as its deemed cost as at the date of transition (1\nst April 2015).\n1.8. Borrowing costs\n 1.8.1. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs also include exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.\n 1.8.2. Borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets (i.e. an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use) are capitalized as a part of the cost of such assets. All other borrowing costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. \n 1.8.3. Investment Income earned on the temporary investment of funds of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n1.9. non-currents assets/disposal Group held for sale \n 1.9.1. Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a \nsale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such assets.\n 1.9.2. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal (upto 5% of the acquisition value).\n 1.9.3.  The disposal group classified as held for sale, are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal.\n 1.9.4. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.\n1.10. leases \n A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset to \nlessee for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23373\n Corporation and its subsidiary shall reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease if the terms and \nconditions of the contract are changed.\n 1.10.1. as a lessee\n  At the commencement date, group recognises a right-of-use asset at cost and a lease liability at present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement date. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Group has right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n  The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability (at present value) adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives (at present value) except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense. Lease of items such as IT Assets (tablets, personal computers, mobiles, POS machines etc.), small items of office furniture etc. are treated as low value. \n  The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the Corporation and its subsidiaries respective incremental borrowing rate computed on periodic basis based on lease term. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Group changes its assessment, whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. \n  Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on systematic basis and Interest on lease liability is charged to statement of profit and loss as Finance cost.\n  The Group has elected not to apply Ind AS 116 \u201cLeases\u201d to Intangible assets. \n 1.10.2. as a lessor\n  A lessor shall classify each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease.\n  1.10.2.1. Finance leases\n   A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.\n   Group shall recognise assets held under a finance lease in its balance sheet and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.\n  1.10.2.2. operating leases\n   A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.\n   Group shall recognise lease payments from operating leases as income on systematic basis in the pattern in which benefit from the use of the underlying asset is diminished.\n1.11. Impairment of Non-financial Assets\n 1.11.1. Non-financial assets other than inventories, deferred tax assets and non-current assets classified as held for sale are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset\u2019s or Cash-Generating Units\u2019 (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited374\n 1.11.2. Goodwill arising from business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected \nto benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n 1.11.3. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n1.12. inventories \n 1.12.1. Inventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of inventories comprises \nof expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing inventories to their present location including appropriate overheads apportioned on a reasonable and consistent basis and are determined on the following basis:\n - Crude oil, traded goods and finished products other than lubricants are determined on First in First out basis.\n - Other raw materials, packages, lubricants and stores and spares are determined on weighted average basis. \n - The cost of Work in Progress is determined at raw material cost plus cost of conversion.\n 1.12.2. Customs duty on Raw materials/Finished goods lying in bonded warehouse are provided for at the applicable rates except where liability to pay duty is transferred to consignee. \n 1.12.3. Excise duty on finished stocks lying at manufacturing locations is provided for at the assessable value applicable at each of the locations based on end use. \n 1.12.4. The net realisable value of finished goods and stock in trade are based on the inter-company transfer prices and final selling prices (applicable at the location of stock) for sale to oil marketing companies and retail consumers respectively. For the purpose of stock valuation, the proportion of sales to oil marketing companies and retail consumers are determined on all India basis and considered for stock valuation at all locations. \n 1.12.5. Raw Materials held for use in the production of finished goods are not written down below cost except in cases where raw material prices have declined and it is estimated that the cost of the finished goods will exceed their net realisable value.\n 1.12.6. Obsolete, slow moving, surplus and defective stocks are identified at the time of physical verification of stocks and where necessary, provision is made for such stocks. \n 1.12.7. In case of BPRL, finished goods of Crude Oil are valued at Cost or Net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of finished goods is determined based on direct cost and directly attributable services cost including depreciation and depletion. The value of such inventories includes royalty (wherever applicable). Cost of inventories other than finished goods, includes expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing inventories to their present location. \n1.13. Revenue Recognition\n 1.13.1. sale of goods\n  Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied by \ntransferring the related goods to the customer. The performance obligation is considered to be satisfied \nwhen the customer obtains control of the goods. \n  Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the transaction price received or receivable (after including transaction price allocations related to arrangements involving more than one performance obligation), net of returns, taxes or duties collected on behalf of the Government and applicable trade discounts or rebates.\n  Revenue is allocated between loyalty programmes and other components of the sale. The amount allocated to the loyalty programme is deferred, and is recognised as revenue when the Corporation has fulfilled its obligation to supply the products under the terms of the programme.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23375\n  Any upfront fees earned by the Corporation with no identifiable performance obligation are recognized \nas revenue on a systematic basis over the period of the Contract. \n  Where the Corporation acts as an agent on behalf of a third party, the associated income is recognised on a net basis.\n  Claims in respect of subsidy on LPG and SKO, from Government of India are booked on in principle acceptance thereof on the basis of available instructions / clarifications, subject to final adjustments as stipulated.\n  In case of BPRL, income from the sale of crude oil and gas produced from the block until the start of commercial production is adjusted against the cost of such block.\n  In case of BPRL, any retrospective revision in prices of crude oil and gas is accounted for in the year of such revision.\n 1.13.2. Construction contracts\n  Revenue from Construction contracts arise from the service concession arrangements entered into by the Group and certain arrangements involving construction of specific assets as part of arrangements involving more than one performance obligation.\n  Contract revenue includes the amount agreed in the contract to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably.\n  Based on an assessment of the terms of such contracts, the contract revenue is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss based on the percentage of completion method. \n  The stage of completion is assessed with reference to the proportion of actual cost incurred as compared to the total estimated cost of the related contract. \n  Contract expenses are recognised as incurred unless they create an asset relating to future contract activity. An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.13.3. Interest income is recognized using effective interest rate (EIR) method.\n 1.13.4. Dividend is recognized when right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of dividend can be measured reliably. \n 1.13.5. Income from sale of scrap is accounted for on realization. \n 1.13.6. In case of the Corporation, claims other than subsidy claims on LPG and SKO, from Government of India are booked when there is a reasonable certainty of recovery.\n1.14. Classification of Income / Expenses\n 1.14.1. Income / expenditure (net) in aggregate pertaining to prior year(s) above the threshold limits are corrected retrospectively in the first set of Financial Statements approved for issue after their discovery by restating the comparative amounts and / or restating the opening Balance Sheet for the earliest prior period presented. \n 1.14.2. Prepaid expenses upto threshold limits in each case, are charged to revenue as and when incurred.\n 1.14.3. Deposits placed with Government agencies / local authorities which are perpetual in nature are charged to revenue in the year of payment.\n1.15. Employee Benefits\n 1.15.1. Short-term employee benefits\n  Short-term employee benefits are recognized as an expense at an undiscounted amount in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss of the year in which the related services are rendered.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited376\n 1.15.2. Post-employment benefits\n  Defined Contribution Plans: \n  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans such as pension are recognized as an \nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a set-off in future payments is available.\n  Defined Benefit Plans: \n  The net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans such as gratuity, other post-employment benefits etc., is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that the employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. \n  The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed at each reporting period end by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the entity, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n  The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as part of employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This net interest is included in employee benefit expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  Re-measurements which comprise of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)), are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n 1.15.3. Other long-term employee benefits\n  Liability towards other long term employee benefits - leave encashment and long service awards etc., are determined on actuarial valuation by qualified actuary by using Projected Unit Credit method. \n  The current service cost of other long terms employee benefits, recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as part of employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the balance of the obligation. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Re-measurements are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.15.4. Termination benefits\n  Expenditure on account of Voluntary Retirement Scheme are charged to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred.\n 1.15.5. employee share Based Payments\n  The Corporation recognizes Equity-settled share-based payments to employees in Statement of Profit and Loss based on estimated fair value of the options on the grant date. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Corporation\u2019s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in Other Equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Corporation revises\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23377\nits estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the \noriginal estimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\n  The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n1.16. Foreign Currency transactions \n 1.16.1. Monetary items:\n  Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at their respective exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. \n  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.\n  Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items (except for long term foreign currency monetary items outstanding as of 31\nst March 2016) are recognized in Consolidated \nStatement of Profit and Loss either as profit or loss on foreign currency transaction and translation or as borrowing costs to the extent regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs. \n  The Group has elected to continue the policy adopted under Previous GAAP for accounting the foreign exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding as of 31\nst March 2016 i.e. foreign exchange differences arising on settlement or translation \nof long-term foreign currency monetary items relating to acquisition of depreciable assets are adjusted to the carrying cost of the assets and depreciated over the balance life of the asset and in other cases, if any, accumulated in \u201cForeign Currency Monetary Item Translation Difference Account\u201d and amortized over the balance period of the liability.\n 1.16.2. non - Monetary items:\n  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.\n 1.16.3. In case of group companies of BPRL, the results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n  Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet.\n  Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and\n  All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n  Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n1.17. Government Grants\n 1.17.1. Government grants are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. \n 1.17.2. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited378\n 1.17.3. Government grants relating to Property, Plant and Equipment are presented as deferred income and are \ncredited to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the asset. \n1.18. Provisions, Contingent l iabilities and Capital Commitments \n 1.18.1. Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n 1.18.2. The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss net of reimbursements, if any.\n 1.18.3. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n 1.18.4. Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the Group, or present obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. \n 1.18.5. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the Financial Statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.\n 1.18.6. Contingent liabilities and Capital Commitments disclosed are in respect of items which in each case are above the threshold limits.\n1.19. Fair Value measurement\n 1.19.1. The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each reporting date.\n 1.19.2. Certain accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non- financial assets and liabilities. \n 1.19.3. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability also reflects its non-performance risk. \n 1.19.4. The best estimate of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determine that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently that difference is recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. \n 1.19.5. While measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation technique as follows: \n  - level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n  - level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) \n  - level 3:  inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23379\n 1.19.6. When quoted price in active market for an instrument is available, the Group measure the fair value of \nthe instrument using that price. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. \n 1.19.7. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses a valuation technique that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. \n 1.19.8. The Group regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If the third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then they assess the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. \n1.20. Financial assets \n 1.20.1. initial recognition and measurement \n  Trade Receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant \nfinancing component are measured at transaction price.\n 1.20.2. subsequent measurement \n  Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial \nassets. Based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset, the Group classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit and loss. \n  debt instruments at amortized cost \n  A \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is \n  - To hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and \n  - Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n  After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. \n  If there is revision in estimates of receipts/contractual cash flows, gross carrying amount of the financial assets are recalculated at period end as the present value of the estimated future contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset\u2019s original effective interest rate due to revision in estimates of receipts. Adjustment, if any, is recognised as income or expense in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  debt instruments at Fair value through other Comprehensive income (FVoCi)\n  A \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the fair value through Other Comprehensive Income if both the following conditions are met:\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited380\n  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both\n  - collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and\n  - contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI on the principal \namount outstanding.\n  After initial measurement, these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income under effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive Income. \n  Debt instruments at Fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \n  Fair Value through Profit or Loss is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation at amortized cost or as FVOCI, is classified as FVTPL.\n  After initial measurement, any fair value changes including any interest income, foreign exchange gain and losses, impairment losses and other net gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss separately.\n  equity investments \n  All equity investments within the scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Such equity instruments \nwhich are held for trading are classified as FVTPL. For all other such equity instruments, the Group decides to classify the same either as FVOCI or FVTPL. They make such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. \n  For equity instruments classified as FVOCI, all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Dividends on such equity instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.20.3. de-recognition \n  A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e. removed from the entity\u2019s Balance Sheet) when\n  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or \n  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset is transferred or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass-through\u2019 arrangement; and either:\n  - The risks and rewards of the asset has been transferred substantially, or \n  - The risk and rewards of the asset are neither transferred nor retained, but the control of the asset is transferred.\n  On de-recognition, any gains or losses on all debt instruments (other than debt instruments measured \nat FVOCI) and equity instruments (measured at FVTPL) are recognized in the Consolidated Statement \nof Profit and Loss. Gains and losses in respect of debt instruments measured at FVOCI and that are accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss on de-recognition. Gains or losses on equity instruments measured at FVOCI that are recognized and accumulated in OCI are not reclassified to profit or loss on de-recognition. \n 1.20.4. Impairment of financial assets \n  In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies Expected Credit Loss (\u201cECL\u201d) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the financial assets measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at FVOCI.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23381\n  Loss allowances on receivables from customers are measured following the \u2018simplified approach\u2019 at an \namount equal to the lifetime ECL at each reporting date. In respect of other financial assets such as loan to LPG Consumers,  debt securities and bank balances, the loss allowance is measured at 12 month ECL only if there is no significant deterioration in the credit risk since initial recognition of the asset or asset is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date. \n1.21. Financial liabilities\n 1.21.1. initial recognition and measurement\n  Financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n  Financial liability is initially measured at fair value minus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.\n 1.21.2. subsequent measurement \n  Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial liabilities. \n  Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \n  A financial liability is classified as at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) if it is classified as held-for-trading or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest expense, are recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. \n  Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n  After initial recognition, financial liabilities other than those which are classified as FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (\u201cEIR\u201d) method. \n  Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortization done using the EIR method is included as finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. \n 1.21.3. de-recognition \n  A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n1.22. Financial guarantees\n Financial guarantee contracts are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms \nof the debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted \nfor transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the fair value initially recognized less cumulative amortization. \n1.23. Derivative financial instruments \n The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the commodity price risk and exposure on account of fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited382\nat fair value with the changes being recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Derivatives are \ncarried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n The fair valuation gains or losses on foreign currency derivatives measured at FVTPL are grouped along with Gain or loss on foreign currency transactions and translations and presented under \u201cOther Income\u201d or \u201cOther expenses\u201d, as the case may be, since these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective and may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109.\n1.24. embedded derivatives \n If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset within the scope of Ind-AS 109, the classification \nrequirements contained in Ind AS 109 are applied to the entire hybrid contract. Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts, including financial liabilities are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not held for trading or designated at fair value through profit and loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, unless designated as effective hedging instruments. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. \n1.25. Offsetting of financial instruments \n Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n1.26. taxes on income\n 1.26.1. Current tax\n  Income tax Assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting period.\n  Current Tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity. \n 1.26.2. deferred tax\n  Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences.\n  Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.\n  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow \nthe deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year \nwhen the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n  Deferred Tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nDeferred Tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity. \n  Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23383\n  Deferred tax is not recognized for\n  \u2022 Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that the \nGroup is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n  \u2022 Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n1.27. earnings per share\n 1.27.1. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period attributable to equity \nshareholders (after deducting preference dividends, if any, and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.\n 1.27.2. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n1.28. Classification of Assets and Liabilities as Current and Non-Current:\n All assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current as per the normal operating cycle (considered as 12 months) and other criteria set out in Schedule III of the Act.\n1.29. Cash and Cash equivalents\n Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet include cash at bank, cash, cheque, draft on hand and demand deposits with an original maturity of less than three months, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. \n For the purpose of Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, cash, cheques and drafts on hand, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Corporation\u2019s cash management. The Group considers all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.\n1.30. Cash Flows\n Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, where by net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are segregated.\n1.31. Joint operations in case of BPRl\n BPRL has Joint arrangement in the nature of Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with the Government of respective countries and/or various bodies corporate for exploration, development and production activities.\n The income, expenditure, assets and liabilities of the Joint operations are merged on a line-by- line basis according to the participating interest with the similar items in the Financial Statements of BPRL.\n1.32. depletion\n In case of BPRL, Depletion charge is calculated on the capitalised cost according to the Unit of Production Method. \nThe Depletion Charge or The Unit of Production (UOP) charge for all costs within a cost centre is calculated by multiplying the UOP rate with the production for the period. The UOP rate for computing depreciation charge for the acquisition cost within a field is arrived at by dividing the acquisition cost of the field by the Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and for all other capitalised costs, by dividing the depreciation base of the cost centre by the Proved Developed Oil and Gas Reserves. The depreciation base of a cost centre includes the gross block of the cost centre and estimated site restoration expenditure and is reduced by the accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment charge of the cost centre. The estimates of proved reserves used are based on the latest technical assessment available with the Group.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited384\n1.33. oil and natural gas producing activities in case of BPRl\n 1.33.1. BPRL follows the accounting policy as explained below for its oil and natural gas exploration and \nproduction activities. \n  i. Acquisition costs such as costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property or mineral right proved or unproved are capitalised. Any pre-acquisition costs are expensed as and when incurred.\n  ii. All costs which are directly attributable to the exploration and evaluation activities of oil and gas are capitalised as Exploratory Wells-in-Progress under \u201cintangible assets under development\u201d. General and administrative costs are included in the exploration and evaluation cost only to the extent that those costs can be directly attributable to the related exploration and evaluation assets. In all other cases, these costs are expensed as incurred.\n  iii. BPRL classifies the acquisition costs, exploration and evaluation assets as tangible asset or intangible asset according to the nature of assets acquired. \n  iv. Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting oil and gas are determinable, exploration and evaluation assets are classified as Development Wells-in-Progress under \u201cintangible assets under development\u201d. Exploration and evaluation asset is assessed for impairment, and impairment loss if any, is recognized, before such reclassification. Subsequent development costs including costs incurred for production facilities are capitalised as and when incurred as intangible assets under development or intangible assets as the case may be.\n  v. When a well within a block or cost centre is ready to commence commercial production, the capitalised costs referred above are reclassified as intangible assets. The cost centre is not normally smaller than a country, except, where warranted by a major difference in economic, fiscal or other factors in the country.\n  vi. When a block or cost centre is relinquished, the accumulated cost is charged off as an expense in the said year.\n  vii.  BPRL capitalises the obligations for removal and restoration that are incurred during a particular period as a consequence of having undertaken the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources and the amount of provision required to be created for subsequent abandonment as part of Property, Plant and Equipment or Intangible Assets, as the case may be. The provision for estimated abandonment costs is made at current prices considering the environment and social obligations, terms of mining lease agreement, industry practice, etc. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate (or rates) is pre-tax rate (or rates) that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where there is an uncertainty of timing on the incurrence of the expenditure, time value of money is not considered while providing for the obligations. Changes in the measurement of existing abandonment costs that result from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation or a change in the discount rate is added to, or deducted from the related field in the current period and is considered for necessary depletion (depreciation) prospectively. The change in the estimated provision due to the periodic unwinding of the discount is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as it occurs.\n\nviii. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The Impairment test is performed in accordance with the procedures given in para 1.11 for impairment of non-financial assets. Impairment loss, if any is recognized as an expense.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23385\n  ix. BPRL allocates exploration and evaluation assets to cash generating units or group of cash \ngenerating units for the purpose of assessing such assets for impairment. \n  x. Gain or loss on sale of interest in a joint operation, is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except that no gain is recognized at the time of such sale if substantial uncertainty exists about the recovery of the costs applicable to the retained interest or if the Group has substantial obligation for future performance. The gain in such situation is treated as recovery of cost related to that joint operation.\n1.34. the Group has adopted materiality threshold limits in the preparation and presentation of Financial \nstatements as given below:\nthreshold item accounting Policy \nReferenceUnit threshold \nlimit Value\nAllocation of other expenses to projects costing in each case 1.4.3 ` Crores 5\nExpenditure on certain items of Property, Plant and Equipment \ncharged to revenue in each case1.4.6 ` 1,000\nCapitalisation of spare parts meeting the definition of Property, Plant and Equipment in each case1.4.7 ` Lakhs 10\nGST on common capital goods per item per month 1.4.10 ` Lakhs 5\nDepreciation at 100 percent in the year of acquisition except LPG Cylinders and Pressure Regulators1.5.6 ` 5,000\nExpenditure incurred for creating / acquiring other intangible assets in each case1.6.2.5 ` Lakhs 50\nIncome / expenditure (net) in aggregate pertaining to prior year(s)1.14.1 ` Crores 150\nPrepaid expenses in each case 1.14.2 ` Lakhs 5\nDisclosure of Contingent liabilities and Capital Commitments in each case1.18.6 ` Lakhs 5\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited386\nnote 2 PRoPeRtY, Plant and eQUiPMent (Consolidated)\n` in Crores\nParticularsGross Block depreciation net Carrying amount\nas at  \n01/04/2022additionsother  \nadjustments Reclassifications /  \ndeductions  \non account of  \nRetirement / \ndisposalas at  \n31/03/2023Up to  \n31/03/2022For the  \nyearReclassifications \n/ deductions  \non account of \nRetirement / \ndisposalUp to  \n31/03/2023as at  \n31/03/2023as at  \n31/03/2022\nFreehold Land*  2,525.97  89.78  -

As a recognition of contribution of employees in growth of the Corporation and increase in shareholders\u2019 value, the Scheme as a primary objective seeks to reward eligible employees for their loyalty/longevity with the Corporation. The Scheme also covered the employees who had opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) during FY 2020-21.\n As per Vesting Condition of the Scheme, the employee had to render services till the date of share transfer or retirement (including VRS) or Death in Service whichever is earlier. In view of the above, the Scheme was accounted as Employee Stock Option Scheme, in line with the applicable Ind AS.\n Each option converted into one equity share of the Corporation upon exercise. No amounts were paid or payable by the recipient on receipt of the option. The options carried neither rights to dividends nor voting rights. These options were vested and exercised on 20\nth April 2021. All options which remained unexercised \nduring FY 2021-22 have lapsed.      \n The share-based payments (options) to employees being equity-settled instruments are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments of the Corporation at the grant date. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Corporation\u2019s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in Total Equity.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23439\nnote 52 sHaRe Based PaYMent (Consolidated) (Contd.)\n(b) Movement during the period\n The number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of the options and movement during the period is \nas follows:\n Particulars 2022-23 2021-22\n   number of WaeP (in ` ) number of WaeP (in ` ) \n options  options\n Opening balance  -     -       3,96,36,732.00   126.54\n Granted during the period -     -       -     -  \n Exercised during the period -     -       (3,65,42,077.00)  126.54\n Forfeited during the period  -     -       (3,71,75.00)  126.54\n Expired during the period  -     -        (30,57,480.00)  126.54\n Closing balance  -     -     -     126.54\n exercisable at period end  -     -     -     -   \n(c) Fair value of options granted\n The model inputs used in the measurement of grant date fair value are as follows:\n Particulars BPCl esPs scheme 2020\n Option pricing model used Black scholes Merton formula\n Fair Value of options on Grant Date ` 235.77\n Share Price on Grant Date ` 385.15\n Exercise price ` 126.54\n Dividend Yield 6.13%\n Expected Volatility* 45.00%\n Risk free interest rate 3.63%\n Expected life of share options 0.56 Years\n *The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of the share price.\n(d) expense arising from share based payment transactions\n Total expense of `77.06 Crores (Previous year : `940.72 Crores) arising from share based payment transactions \nis recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as an Exceptional Item.\nnote 53  iMPaiRMent oF assets (Consolidated)\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date, whether there is an indication for impairment of assets. The Group \ntakes into consideration external and internal source of information available about the asset to check whether any indication for impairment exists. If any such indication exists, the corporation estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. The value in use is assessed based on the estimated future cash flows which are discounted to their present value using the discount rate that reflects the time value of money and risk specific to the assets for which the future cash flows estimates have not been adjusted.

The functional currency of \nthe Corporation is Indian Rupee and its Indian Subsidiaries is Indian Rupee. Our exposure is mainly denominated in US dollars (USD). The USD exchange rate has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.\nThe Group has put in place a Financial Risk Management Policy to Identify the most effective and efficient ways of \nmanaging the currency risks. The Group uses derivative instruments, (mainly foreign exchange forward contracts) to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in line with our policy.\nThe Group does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited450\nnote 55 FinanCial instRUMents (Consolidated) (Contd.)\nexposure to currency risk\nThe currency profile in INR of foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31st March 2023 and  \n31stMarch 2022 are as below:\n`in Crores\nas at 31st March 2023 Usd eURo JPY CHF others\nFinancial assets \nCash and cash equivalents  410.14  0.08  -    -    0.43 \nTrade receivables and other assets  1,061.67  -    -    -    0.15 \nnet exposure for assets  1,471.81  0.08  -    -    0.58 \nFinancial liabilities  \nBonds  4,100.75  -    -    -    -   \nLong Term Loans (Foreign Currency)  6,160.00  -    -    -    -   \nShort term borrowings  3,412.00  -    -    -    -   \nTrade Payables and other liabilities  12,666.25  33.91  13.27  -    1.07 \nAdd/(Less): Foreign currency forward exchange contracts  (1,031.91)  -    -    -    -   \nnet exposure for liabilities  25,307.09  33.91  13.27  -    1.07 \nnet exposure (assets - liabilities) (23,835.28) (33.83) (13.27)  -    (0.49)\n`in Crores\nas at 31st March 2022 Usd eURo JPY CHF others\nFinancial assets \nCash and cash equivalents  238.95  0.09  -     -     0.31 \nTrade receivables and other assets  3,135.78  -     -     -     0.02 \nnet exposure for assets  3,374.73  0.09  -     -     0.33 \nFinancial liabilities  \nBonds  7,566.61  -     -     -     -    \nLong Term Loans (Foreign Currency)  6,013.11  -     -     -     -    \nTrade Payables and other liabilities  22,382.60  38.69  16.58  0.16  5.70 \nAdd/(Less): Foreign currency forward exchange contracts  (1,856.17)  -     -     -     -    \nnet exposure for liabilities  34,106.15  38.69  16.58  0.16  5.70 \nnet exposure (assets - liabilities)  (30,731.42)  (38.60)  (16.58)  (0.16)  (5.37)\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23451\nnote 55 FinanCial instRUMents (Consolidated) (Contd.)\nsensitivity analysis\nA reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the USD against INR at 31st March would have affected the \nmeasurement of financial instruments denominated in US dollars and affected profit or loss by the amounts shown \nbelow.

In cases where the related foreign exchange fluctuation is capitalised to Property, Plant and Equipment or recognised directly in reserves,  the impact indicated below may affect the Group\u2019s Statement of Profit and Loss over the remaining life of the related Property, Plant and Equipment or the remaining tenure of the borrowing respectively.\n`in Crores\neffect in inR (before tax)\nFor the year ended 31st March, 2023Profit or loss\nstrengthening Weakening\n3% movement \nUSD  (715.06)  715.06 \n (715.06)  715.06 \n`in Crores\neffect in inR (before tax)\nFor the year ended 31st March, 2022Profit or loss\nstrengthening Weakening\n3% movement \nUSD  (921.94)  921.94 \n (921.94)  921.94 \nC.iv.b interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest rate risk is \nthe risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates, in cases where the borrowings are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest bearing investments will fluctuate because of fluctuations in the interest rates.  \nThe Group\u2019s approach to managing interest rate risk is to have a judicious mix of borrowed funds with fixed and floating interest rate obligation.\nexposure to interest rate risk\nGroup\u2019s interest rate risk arises primarily from borrowings.  The interest rate profile of the Group\u2019s interest-bearing \nfinancial instruments is as follows:\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited452\nnote 55 FinanCial instRUMents (Consolidated) (Contd.)\n`in Crores\nParticularsnote \nReferenceas at  \n31st March 2023as at  \n31st March 2022\nFixed-rate instruments\nFinancial assets - measured at amortised cost\nInvestment in debt instruments 8  0.01  0.01 \nInvestments in FD & TREP 16  1,785.53  1,395.85 \nFinancial Assets - measured at Fair Value through Profit \n& loss\nInvestment in debt instruments 14  4,277.14  4,442.27 \ntotal of Fixed Rate Financial assets  6,062.68  5,838.13 \nFinancial liabilities - measured at amortised cost\nBonds 25 & 30  9,062.40  12,018.58 \nNon- Convertible Debentures 25 & 30  6,369.72  6,183.41 \nShort term borrowings 30  -    5,202.00 \nInterest Free Term Loan 25  221.81  37.42 \ntotal of Fixed Rate Financial liabilities  15,653.93  23,441.41 \nVariable-rate instruments\nFinancial assets - measured at amortised cost\nLoan to Joint Venture 9 & 18  11.25  15.00 \nFinancial Assets - measured at Fair Value through Profit \n& loss\nLoan to Joint Venture 9  2,037.28  1,897.20 \ntotal of Variable Rate Financial assets  2,048.53  1,912.20 \nFinancial liabilities - measured at amortised cost\nLong Term Loans (Foreign Currency) 25 & 30  6,160.00  6,013.11 \nShort Term Loans (Foreign Currency) 30  3,412.00  -   \nShort term borrowings 30  3,750.00  2,295.00 \nTerm loans 25 & 30  31,478.68  24,183.16 \ntotal of Variable Rate Financial liabilities  44,800.68  32,491.27 \nIn respect of Foreign Currency Loans, the Corporation has entered into Interest Rate Swaps of Usd 65 Million \n(Previous year: USD 65 Million)\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23453\nnote 55 FinanCial instRUMents (Consolidated) (Contd.)\ninterbank offered rate (iBoR) additional information\nThe Group has following exposure to LIBOR as at 31st March 2023:\nnature of transactionPrincipal amount in Million \nUsd as on 31st March 2023Rate of interest Year of Repayment\nTerm loan Facilities  325.00 LIBOR + Margin 2023-24\nExternal Commercial Borrowing  300.00 LIBOR + Margin 2023-24\nTerm loan Facilities  900.00 LIBOR + Margin 2024-25\nTerm loan Facilities  100.00 LIBOR + Margin 2025-26\nTerm loan Facilities  455.00 LIBOR/SOFR + \nMargin2026-27\nInterest Rate Swap ( 6 monthly)  65.00    Pay- Fix Rate\n2023-24\nReceive -LIBOR\nIn March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), UK had confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to \nbe provided by any administrator or no longer be representative:\n- immediately after 31st December 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and \nthe 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings; and\n- immediately after 30th June 2023, in the case of the remaining US dollar settings.\nThe aforementioned exposures shall be migrated from LIBOR to an Alternative Reference Rate in line with the \nannouncement. The impact of such migration is not significant.\nFair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments\nThe Corporation accounts for certain investments in fixed-rate financial assets such as investments in Oil bonds and \nGovernment Securities at fair value through profit or loss. Accordingly, a decrease in 25 basis points in interest rates is likely to increase the profit or loss (before tax)  for the year ending 31\nst March 2023 by ` 19.26 Crores (Previous \nyear: `29.43 Crores) and an increase in 25 basis points in interest rates is likely to decrease the profit or loss (before \ntax) for the year ending 31st March 2023 by ` 19.14 Crores (Previous year: ` 29.18 Crores).\nCash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments\nA reasonably possible change of 25 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased \n(decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. In cases where the related interest rate risk is capitalised to Property, Plant and Equipment, the impact indicated below may affect the Group\u2019s income statement over the remaining life of the related Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited454\nnote 55 FinanCial instRUMents (Consolidated) (Contd.)\n`in Crores\nCash flow sensitivity (net)Profit or (loss)\n0.25 % increase 0.25% decrease\nas at 31st March 2023\nVariable-rate loan instruments  (93.15)  93.15 \nCash flow sensitivity (net)  (93.15)  93.15 \nas at 31st March 2022\nVariable-rate loan instruments  (80.25)  80.25 \nCash flow sensitivity (net)  (80.25)  80.25 \nC.iv.c Commodity rate risk \nGroup\u2019s profitability gets affected by the price differential (also known as Margin or Crack spread) between prices \nof products (output) and the price of the crude oil and other feed-stocks used in production (input). Prices of both are set by markets. Hence, Group uses derivatives instruments (swaps, futures, options, and forwards) to hedge exposures to commodity price risk to cover refinery operating cost using Basic Swaps on various products cracks like Naphtha, Gasoline (Petrol), Jet/Kerosene, Gasoil (Diesel) and Fuel Oil against Benchmark Dubai Crude. Further volatility in freight costs is hedged through Freight Forwards and bunker purchases. Settlement of all derivative transactions take place on the basis of monthly average of the daily prices of the settlement month quoted by Platts.\nGroup measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions using value-at-risk techniques. These \ntechniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding period.\nGroup uses historical model of VAR techniques based on variance/covariance to make a statistical assessment \nof the market risk arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period and within a 95% confidence level. The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account positions and the history of price movements for last two years. Since there are no open positions as on 31\nst March 2023 VAR for open \nposition as on 31st March 2023 is NIL.\n\nAnnual Report 2022-23455\nnote 55 FinanCial instRUMents (Consolidated) (Contd.)\nC.iv.d Price risk\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to equity investments price risk arises from investments held by the Group and classified in \nthe financial statements at fair value through OCI.

Even as we navigate a challenging business \nenvironment, our focus continues to be professionalism and good governance in all aspects of our business. This is reflected in the excellent operational performance by all \nbusiness units during the year and the sharp turnaround \nin the financial results in the latter part of the year, after being severely impacted by global headwinds in the first half of FY 2022-23.\nThe domestic economy\u2019s resilience through the crisis of a \nonce-in-a-century pandemic followed by the geopolitical \ncrisis has been remarkable. While most of the major economies continue to grapple with fiscal challenges, India has been an oasis of growth and stability. India was second biggest contributor to world growth in 2022. \nOur economy grew at 7.2% in FY 2022-23, and the \ndomestic consumption of petroleum products grew at \n10.6%. You will be pleased to know that your company recorded the highest-ever market sales of 48.92 MMT in the year, as against 42.51 MMT in the comparative period, registering a growth of 15%. With a market share of 25%, we retained our position as the second-largest Oil Marketing Company during the year. Our refineries \nsupported the marketing efforts by recording the highest-\never throughput of 38.53 MMT in FY 2022-23, at a capacity utilization of 109%. \nOur revenue from operations rose to all-time high of ` 5.3 \ntrillion as against `4.3 trillion in the previous year, making \nus the sixth-largest company across all categories in the \ncountry by turnover. BPCL\u2019s colors shine brightest when it meets challenges head on. In this challenging year which was marred by suppressed marketing margins on certain petroleum products, our robust refineries achieved their all-time high Gross Refining Margins (GRMs) at $20.24/\nbbl, highest amongst the PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The year\u2019s financial performance was volatile with two-\nquarters of losses, but these were put behind with a \nrecord-breaking performance in the fourth quarter, with standalone profit rising 159% year-on-year and 231% \nquarter-on-quarter to ` 64.78 billion. For the year as \na whole, the company posted a standalone net profit \nof `18.70 billion as compared to the restated profit of \n`113.63 billion in FY 2021-22.\nIndia is increasingly assuming a leadership role in the comity of nations. The country\u2019s democratic fabric, consistent economic growth and focus on sustainability \nare receiving acclaim globally. Having become the 5\nth \nlargest economy in the world, the country is well on \ncourse to becoming a $10 trillion economy by 2035. As \nthe industrialization and urbanization in India gathers"

There is \npotential for India\u2019s share of global oil demand to rise \nto 11% in the coming years from around 5% currently. \nA burgeoning middle class will be looking for innovative \nsolutions for their energy requirements. India's ambitious goal of attaining net-zero emissions by 2070, combined \nwith its strong determination to become Aatmanirbhar \nin energy by 2047, is set to accelerate the adoption of \ncleaner and more efficient energy solutions. This opens \nup significant economic opportunities for the companies operating in the energy sector.\nWith the existing diverse portfolio of products and \nservices, and our strategic aspirations centered on the \nprinciples of Nurturing the Core \u2013 refining, upstream and \nmarketing of petroleum products; and Investing in future \nbig bets \u2013 petrochemicals, gas, non-fuel, green energy and digital, the company is well positioned to play a critical role in the energy landscape of India and to increase its \nglobal footprints.

With a staggering investment of ` 490 billion, this \nproject marks a historic milestone as the largest single investment in BPCL's illustrious history. The project also involves brownfield expansion of the Bina refinery capacity from 7.8 MMTPA to 11 MMTPA, to primarily cater to the feed requirements of petrochemical plants.  \nThis project will drive the production of essential \npetrochemicals, increasing the share of petrochemicals \nin the company\u2019s product portfolio to about 8%. This \ninvestment fits well with the government\u2019s mission to make India a self-reliant and globally competitive \npetrochemical manufacturing hub.\nThe disruptions in the global energy supply chain and \nthe soaring oil prices have brought the issue of supply security to the fore - not just for your company but for the \ncountry as well. The Company will continue its focus and efforts on the upstream Oil & Gas projects, particularly to \nenable earliest monetization of the discoveries made in \nMozambique and Brazil. The initial 2-Train LNG Project in Area 1, Mozambique which is the first step towards  \nunlocking the world-class gas resources of approximately \n63 Trillion Cubic Feet in which BPCL holds 10% stake, is \npoised to resume operations in the latter part of 2023. We \nare confident that this will propel us to new heights on the energy frontier.\nDuring the year, the Company strategically fortified its gas \nportfolio by seamlessly integrating Bharat Gas Resources Limited (BGRL) through the merger. We are steadfastly \nworking towards development of the City Gas Distribution \nnetwork with a capital outlay of over ` 375 billion.  \nTo strengthen the supply chain and streamline the distribution of essential petroleum products, the Company is investing around ` 27.53 billion in Petroleum \nOil Lubricants and Lube Oil Base Stock installations at Rasayani in Maharashtra and product pipeline from its Mumbai Refinery to Rasayani. \nI am happy to share that we are investing almost ` 10 \nbillion to set up two 50MW captive wind power plants \nin Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to support our \nrefineries in Mumbai and Bina.

The Company has a keen eye for identifying opportunities for growth through tapping of congruity and synergies.\nIn this pursuit, the fi  nancial year 2022-23 was a landmark year in the history of BPCL, as two strategic \nmergers were brought to fruition. On July 1, 2022, Bharat Oman Refi  neries Limited (BORL) was merged with BPCL, followed by the merger of Bharat Gas Resources Limited (BGRL) with BPCL on August 16, 2022.\nThese mergers have proven immensely benefi  cial, enabling BPCL to consolidate its refi  ning and gas \nportfolios and unlocking substantial synergies. The benefi  ts include centralized procurement for \nthe merged entities, enhanced tax effi  ciencies by eliminating inter-company transactions, seamless \nalignment of business processes, and the pooling of talent and expertise. Additionally, the merger with BORL has empowered BPCL to pursue its ambitious Ethylene Cracker Project at Bina.\nThe harmonious blend of these mergers will undoubtedly create a combination of value that is both \ntransformative and exceptional \u2013 an extraordinary symphony of synergies."

This difficult context highlights a \nmultitude of challenges. \nThe global economic trends have been mixed, reflecting \nboth improved conditions and persisting downside \nrisks, largely centering on inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. The actions taken in the recent past by the policymakers are likely to play a significant role in the pace and course of the world\u2019s economic recovery.\nGLobAL ecoNomYIn the fiscal year 2022-23, policymakers faced a \nparadoxical challenge of managing inflation while simultaneously supporting economic growth. During \nthe first half of the year, global economic activity was \nexperiencing a broad-based and sharper-than-expected slowdown, with inflation higher than that seen in several decades. \nGlobal inflation surged to 8.7% from 4.7% in 2021, \novershooting targets in most countries throughout the year. Central banks have contended that near-term growth sacrifice would be needed to bring down inflation to protect the long-term prospects for growth. This surge in inflation triggered successive interest rate hikes by central banks, thereby pulling back liquidity from the system, which eventually marred the growth outlook. \nAs per the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global \nGDP growth rate experienced a slowdown, declining from 6.0% in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022. Furthermore, it is projected to drop to 2.8% in 2023. Advanced economies are expected to see slower growth in near future, with a \nforecast of below 1.3% in 2023 compared to 2.7% in 2022.\nHowever, recent high-frequency indicators suggest that \nthe momentum of global growth is sustained in the second quarter of 2023. The global composite Purchasing \nManagers\u2019 Index (PMIs) rose to an 18-month high in May \n2023, powered by the services sector. The US economy is slowing but at a gradual pace, with jobs growth and wage \nlevels holding despite successive hikes in interest rates \nby the Federal Reserve since March 2022. Global inflation is easing, but slowly. Some commodity prices have \ndeclined amidst the easing of supply chain pressures. \nGlobal food prices have also fallen to their lowest levels \nin two years, with declines in grains, vegetable oil and \ndairy prices.  \nGlobal trade remains a challenge and has taken a hit due \nto rising protectionism in several countries. There has been a realignment of global supply chains due to the war in Ukraine and fragmentation in finance and technology \nflows. Foreign Direct Investment flows have slowed. \nVarious projections show that while services exports will be high, export of manufactured goods is likely to be on the lower side.\nWith monetary policy focused on moderating inflation \nwhile stabilizing financial markets, fiscal policy is left as \nthe potential tool to boost economic growth. With public \ndebt at historically elevated levels, there is less room for expansionary fiscal policy. However, receding of the dislocations created by the Russian-Ukraine war, easing \npressure on global supply chain, decline in shipping \ncosts and the opening up of China after the prolonged COVID restrictions offer a semblance of positivity to the global economy.\nIndia & World GDP Growth %Percentage\nUSD trillion\n (8.00) (6.00) (4.00) (2.00) -  2.00  4.00  6.00  8.00  10.00 \n -  0.50  1.00  1.50  2.00  2.50  3.00  3.50  4.00 India & World GDP Growth %\nIndia GDP  : GDP (current USD trillion) World IndiaPercentage\nUSD trillion\nApr-22\nMay-22\nJun-22\nJul-22\nAug-22\nSep-22\nOct-22\nNov-22\nDec-22\nJan-23\nFeb-23\nMar-23\nApr-230510CPI Inflation (2012 Base)\n  \n  \n  \nMonthly CPI Inflation (2012 Base) RBI Tolerance Band\nApr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun626772778287INR v/s USD"

The Indian economy is cautiously shining and the growth moderation for India in the financial year 2022-23 is premised on an ongoing global economic slowdown, tight monetary conditions, and elevated oil prices.\nAs per the National Statistical Office\u2019s provisional \nestimates released on May 31, 2023, the Indian economy grew 7.2% in 2022-23, up from 7.0% estimated earlier. The GDP growth for the year exceeded the estimate due to strong growth in the last quarter of the year. GDP grew 6.1% in the January-March quarter, up from 4.5% in the October-December quarter. The GDP growth was 9.1% in 2021-22, supported by a favourable base effect due to low growth in the pandemic year. \nAmong the broad sectors in the economy, the services \nsector continued to rebound, driving growth during the year. Services sector grew 9.3% in 2022-23, much more than the growth in agriculture and industry combined. The government\u2019s thrust on infrastructure has also helped boost growth. In the year 2022-23, the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), a crucial measure of investments in the economy, demonstrated significant growth, increasing by 11.4%. The growth was primarily driven by increased construction activity, which, in turn, positively impacted key indicators like steel consumption, cement production, and imports of capital goods. \nIndia also experienced a surge in inflation during 2022-\n23, mainly due to global supply shocks and high input costs. The sharp rise in international crude oil prices, food, fertilisers and metals exerted broad-based price pressures during the year. As a result, Consumer Price Index inflation reached a peak of 7.8% in April 2022. Inflation moderated after the gradual normalisation of global supply chains, softening of global commodity prices, government supply management measures and monetary tightening by the Reserve Bank of India. Overall, inflation rose to 6.7% in 2022-23 from 5.5% in 2021-22.The Indian Rupee declined by 8.5% against the US dollar over the last fiscal. This depreciation, rather than a reflection of India\u2019s macro-economic fundamentals, is more as a result of capital outflow and appreciation in the dollar\u2019s value due to interest rate hikes in the US.\nDriven by strong domestic demand and capital expenditure \npush from the government, India will be one of the major beacons of growth in 2023-24. The Indian economy is expected to grow by 6.5% in 2023-24. Several high-frequency indicators suggest that the Indian economy is on course to meet the growth projection for the year. The year 2023-24 is expected to see faster growth in investment, thanks to sound macroeconomic policies & fundamentals and robust balance sheets of corporates and banks. Global geopolitical tensions, slowdown in the global economy & volatility due to new stress events in global financial systems pose a downside risk to the growth outlook.\ntreNDs iN the GLobAL oiL AND GAs sector\nThe global energy markets were engulfed by a crisis very \ndifferent from the ones in the past as the major primary energy sources, viz., crude, gas and coal were disrupted in a scale of unprecedented breadth and complexity. Russia has been among the largest exporter of fossil fuels, but its chocking of natural gas to Europe and EU sanctions on imports of oil and coal from Russia has severely impaired global energy trade.\nThe spot prices of natural gas had reached levels never \nseen before, regularly exceeding the equivalent of USD 250 for a barrel of oil. Coal prices had also hit record levels, while oil rose well above USD 100 per barrel in mid-2022 before falling back. High gas and coal prices account for 90% of the upward pressure on electricity costs around the world. The crisis has stoked inflationary pressures and created a looming risk of recession."

This trend is due to the lack of new discoveries, diminishing output from matured fields and operational issues encountered in some fields.\nIndia imported 232.7 MMT of crude in 2022-23, up from \n212.4 MMT in the preceding year. The import bill for crude oil surged 31% on a year-to-year basis to $158.3 billion. India\u2019s gross petroleum imports, which include crude oil and petroleum products, totalled 277.3 MMT, incurring an expense of $184.4 billion. This is as compared to 251.4 MMT in the previous year, amounting to outflow of $144.3 billion. India exported 61 MMT petroleum products worth $57.3 billion, compared with 62.8 MMT or $44.4 billion worth of products in 2021-22. India\u2019s reliance on imported crude increased to 87.3% of domestic consumption in 2022-23, up from 85.5% in 2021-22. Oil import dependency was 84.4% in 2020-21, 85% in 2019-20, and 83.8% in 2018-19. The production of petroleum products from domestic crude oil was 28.2 MMT in 2022-23, roughly 12.7%, down from 14.5% in 2021-22. Processing of high sulphur crude in total crude processing rose to 77.5% in 2022-23 from 76.6% in 2021-22. During 2022-23, natural gas production rose slightly to \n34,450 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meters (MMSCM) and consumption in India fell to around 60,000 MMSCM from 64,159 MMSCM in the previous year. LNG imports into India fell 14% to around 26,000 MMSCM during the year. \nIndia\u2019s expected growth rates for the next ten years and the \ngrowth rate of automobile sales, even with rising adoption of EVs, clearly indicates that the current demand levels for auto fuels will remain strong at least for the next ten years. Until heavy vehicles and buses adopt alternate fuels, including CNG, demand for liquid auto fuels will remain strong. International Energy Agency (IEA) says India\u2019s oil demand could rise to 6.7 mb/d by 2030 and to 7.4 mb/d by 2040.\nHaving achieved the target of 10% ethanol blending in \n2022, India has advanced the target of achieving 20% ethanol blending and 5% biodiesel blending to the years 2025 and 2030, respectively. India is also witnessing early signs of transition towards EVs on the back of policy mandates. However, the challenges related to battery technology and the range-anxiety of EVs remain, which are being addressed.\nMost of the growth in renewables energy is expected to \ncome from solar and wind.

These challenges have elevated \nenergy security, affordability, and sustainability to the \nforefront, now serving as the guiding principles for the energy sector.\nClimatologists say that 2023 will likely end up being the \nhottest year ever. The average worldwide temperature \nreached 17.23\u00b0C (63.01\u00b0F) in July, which is a record. The rising temperatures are increasing the frequency \nof extreme weather events in recent years. Despite strong governmental intent, carbon emissions have only \nincreased since the Paris Climate Change Conference, COP 2015. Therefore, more commitments are needed \nurgently. India has made the historic announcement of reaching Net Zero by the year 2070. To achieve \nthis milestone, the scale of transformation required in India is massive, given the country\u2019s galloping energy \nneeds due to a growing economy, industrialisation, and \nurbanisation.\nAbout $2.8 trillion is set to be invested globally in energy \nin 2023, of which more than $1.7 trillion is expected to \ngo to clean technologies \u2013 including renewables, EVs, \nand nuclear power. The remainder, slightly more than \n$1 trillion, is going to coal, gas, and oil. This means \naround 60% investment is flowing in renewables and \nthe rest in fossil fuels. \nThe path to becoming net zero carbon companies \nopened many revenue-generating opportunities. There \nhas been a rapid growth of renewable energy in India\u2019s \nenergy mix in recent years. India is currently ranked 4\nth \nin renewable energy installed capacity and the share \nof renewable energy is continuously on the rise due to strong policy support and a fall in input costs. Green \nmobility and the proliferation of renewable energy are \nincreasingly becoming viable due to the continuous \ndevelopment in technology, which is driving down the \ncost while increasing efficiency. Massive government \npolicy support, as well as a growing environmental \nawareness is spurring the adoption of electric vehicles. \nElectricity generation via solar and wind offers significant \nopportunities. Investment in solar is set to overtake \nthe amount of investment going into oil production for the first time, an IEA study has revealed.  India has \nhuge potential for solar energy, and the cost of solar power has come down. Other technologies that could \nattract investments are those relating to battery storage technology, pumped hydro, and upgraded intelligent \nelectricity grids.  Some of these areas in renewables will serve as high-investment and innovation areas requiring sustained focus and support from companies, including \ntraditional oil and gas companies. \nbiofuels are expected to play an important role in the \noil and gas industry in promoting energy sustainability \nand security as India progresses toward a clean energy \necosystem. Long-Term Offtake Agreements between oil \ncompanies and ethanol plants have been helping. India \nachieved the targeted 10% ethanol blending in May \n2022, much ahead of the target date of November 2022 \nand has gone on to prepone the timeline by 5 years to \n2025 for an ambitious blending target of 20%. \nThe National Policy on Biofuels announced in 2018 by \nthe Government of India put thrust on the production of \nadvanced biofuels such as 2G ethanol, CBG, Waste to Fuels, \ndrop-in fuels etc., through the utilization of indigenous \nfeedstocks. India set a target of 5% biodiesel blending in \ndiesel by 2030. The Policy encourages the setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from \nnon-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil (UCO), and short \ngestation crops. \u2018SATAT\u2019 (Sustainable Alternative Towards \nAffordable Transportation) initiative on Compressed Bio-Gas (cbG) envisages production of 15 MMT of CBG and \n50 MMT of manure from 5,000 CBG plants.\nhydrogen is increasingly being seen not only as a \npotential solution to the predicaments of the present \nglobal energy system \u2013 mainly climate change and air"

Its implied volatility, the metric that captures the market\u2019s view of the likelihood of fluctuations in its value, is at its lowest since 2008. This is despite a sharp rise in the dollar index during the year because of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive interest rate-raising campaign.\nBelying market fears of a possible spike in India\u2019s \nexternal vulnerabilities, India\u2019s current account deficit at 2% of GDP during 2022-23 remained sustainable, although it expanded from 1.2% a year ago. The merchandise trade deficit widened to $265.3 billion from $189.5 billion a year ago. This, combined with lower net capital inflows than in the previous year, led to depletion in the foreign exchange reserves to the tune of $9.1 billion on a balance of payments basis during 2022-23. Including valuation effects, however, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves declined by US$ 28.9 billion during 2022-23. Forex reserves in July 2023 stood at USD 609 billion. \nWith the US and other major economies raising \ninterest rates or keeping them high for a long time, \ncountries like India and even China would find it hard \nto cut interest rates or take other measures to support \ndomestic demand.

The need for \nthis CSR intervention is justified as the critical patients did not have \nlimited provision of comprehensive care at the medical facility. As a result of this project, there is a reported reduction in the number of referral cases by the doctors at GMC. The treatment of critical patients \ncan be done at the upgraded facility.

Our findings are that the construction is of extremely good quality and is being maintained well. Further discussions with key stakeholders revealed that the laboratories constructed under the project were reported to be not functional to its full capacity because \nof a) lack of equipment and teaching aids b) shortage of furniture \nfor students c) lack of supply of water/gas in the laboratories. As a result of these shortcomings, the project has not been able to have evident impact on academic improvement.The facility has potential \nto provide good exposure to students and help them perform in \nscience competions if the above shortcomings are addressed.  The principal in written letter has accepted the positive feedback and has sought support for equipment and willingness to address the other shortcomings so as to make the labs functional."

As a public sector undertaking tasked with providing energy security to the citizens of the country, BPCL has always adhered to the principles of responsible business in conducting its operations. BPCL is one of the early adopters of ESG reporting in India. The Company first published its Sustainability Report way back in the year 2006. Over the years, the Company has been improving its disclosures, in line with the GRI standards.\n It has been our topmost priority to uphold the principles of Corporate Governance to ensure transparency, integrity, and accountability in our functioning. We have in place strong frameworks that maintain high standards of ethical and responsible conduct of business. BPCL rigorously follows best HR practices. The Company encourages inclusive growth by providing employment and training opportunities to weaker sections of the society. Safety and well-being of our employees and contractual workers have always been a priority area of work. Safety continues to be the baseline of all our actions. We need to strengthen our culture of safety by being both proactive and prepared in the work environment as well as off work. \n BPCL is a responsible global citizen. As the flagship oil company of the country, BPCL has ensured that critical energy needs are met across the length and breadth of the country even during natural disasters or periods of national emergency. The Company is the leading implementing agency for many community development schemes of the Government of India such as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), providing free LPG connections to BPL women, etc. BPCL R&D has pioneered several indigenous technologies in process/product improvements, in the spirit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Our procurement policies are aligned to support and promote MSMEs and start-ups.

Through this scheme, BPCL is also helping in creating rural employment opportunities and nurturing entrepreneurship. Beyond this, BPCL has a dedicated CSR programme which undertakes various community development initiatives across the country.\n Through its efforts in emission mitigation, water and energy conservation, waste reduction, improvement in energy efficiency, BPCL has been proactively working towards reducing its operational impact on the environment. At the same time, the Company is also focusing towards greening its product mix through investments in renewable energy, biofuels, hydrogen, cleaner petroleum products and encouraging circular economy.

Plastics (including packaging):  As BPCL is in \nthe business of Lubes manufacturing, packaging and selling of lubricants under the brand name of \u201cMAK\u201d in Indian market, as a brand owner BPCL is required to establish a system for \nmanagement of plastic waste generated for \nsales of our products under Extended Producers \nResponsibility (EPR) for plastic waste recycling, \nvide policy notified on February 16, 2022 for plastic packaging undertaken for lubricants as brand owner. In the year 2022-23, BPCL Lubes business unit has collected 3,172 MT waste plastic from market and reprocessed it through CPCB-approved party, which has used this processed plastic in making various plastic items used in day-to-day applications.\n 2. E-waste:  Electronic waste is disposed of \nby Refinery Warehouse through authorized recyclers as per the E-waste guidelines (Form-3). In FY 2022-23 a quantity of 3.22 tons of E waste disposed.\n 3. hazardous waste\n  a. Spent Catalyst: As per CPCB guidelines, BPCL refineries have adopted a system for disposal of Solid Hazardous waste by \nrecycling recoverable type of the spent catalyst \nthrough CPCB/SPCB-approved re-processors \nfor recovery of metals. The rest spent solid \nhazardous waste is disposed of to a common treatment facility approved by SPCB.   Hazardous Waste Disposal sites or sites \ndeveloped within refineries which are \nconstructed with safety features like proper \nimpermeable liners, leachate collection system, protection from rain etc. These sites are regularly monitored for ground water contamination.\n  b. slop oil: Oily sludge waste generated \nduring handing over of equipment/tankages, turnarounds or routine operations etc. is collected from various locations in refinery and it is sent to weathering pit for recovery of oil. After recovery by chemical and mechanical methods, residual sludge from weathering pit is sent for Bioremediation. Slop oil generated from process units is reprocessed along \nwith crude in crude distillation column. At \nmarketing and pipeline locations slop oil is recycled after decanting in sump tank and pumping back to product system.\n  c. oily sludge : Oily sludge waste generated \nduring handing over of equipment/tankages, turnarounds or routine operations etc. is collected from various locations, in refinery and it is sent to weathering pit for recovery of oil. After recovery of oil by chemical and mechanical methods, residual sludge from weathering pit is sent for Bioremediation which is a process that uses naturally occurring microorganisms to transform harmful substances to non-toxic compounds. \nAs per Hazardous Waste Rules, 2016, oil \ncontent in sludge waste should be less than 0.5% before it can be disposed of. \n 4.

We have audited the accompanying Standalone Indian Accounting Standards (\u201cInd AS\u201d) Financial Statements \nof Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (\u201cthe Corporation\u201d), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date, and a summary of the Significant Accounting Policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements \u201d).\n2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (\u201cInd AS\u201d), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Corporation as at March 31, 2023, the profit and total comprehensive income, its cash flows and changes in equity for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for Opinion\n3. We conducted our audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on \nAuditing (\u201cSAs\u201d) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Corporation in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u2019s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.\nKey Audit Matters\n4. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of \nthe Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:"

Valuation of Investment in E&P Subsidiary \n(Refer Note 7 and Note 56):\nThe Corporation has an investment of \nRs.9,601.37 crores in 100% subsidiary Bharat \nPetro Resources Ltd (BPRL). This subsidiary along with its stepdown subsidiaries, JVs & Associates holds participating interest in various oil/gas blocks for exploration & evaluation, development, and production activities (E&P).\nThe Corporation\u2019s realisation from these E&P \ninvestments is dependent on the continued successful operations/development of reserves resulting in expected earnings and revenue growth of the respective companies. BPRL has relinquished or impaired certain oil and gas blocks on account of changes in circumstances and prospects of the blocks.\nThe above factors have impacted the value in \nuse of BPRL\u2019s assets and consequently the Corporation\u2019s impairment analysis in respect of its Investment in BPRL. Accordingly, we considered this as a Key Audit Matter.The following procedures were carried out in this regard:\n\u2022 We evaluated the design, implementation and \noperating effectiveness of key controls in relation to the annual impairment testing activity carried out by the Corporation for its investments in Subsidiary.\n\u2022 We reviewed the audited consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements of BPRL for FY 2022-23 and the independent auditor\u2019s report thereon.\n\u2022 We assessed the Management\u2019s explanation regarding key factors which have led to significant diminution in value of BPRL\u2019s assets vis-\u00e0-vis the previous year and consequent trigger for impairment of the Corporation\u2019s investment in the same.\n\u2022 We evaluated the impairment analysis carried out during the year by the Corporation, which included an independent comparison of externally / internally assessed value in use of BPRL\u2019s Net Assets with carrying cost of investment in BPRL in the Corporation\u2019s Books of Account.\n2. Computation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL):\nTrade receivables and loans granted under the Pradhan Mantri Ujwala Yojana (PMUY) scheme constitute a significant component of the total current assets of the Corporation. At each reporting date, the Corporation recognizes Lifetime ECL on Trade Receivables using a \u2018simplified approach\u2019 and 12 month ECL on loans are granted under the PMUY scheme wherein we relied on Management\u2019s estimates regarding probability of default rates linked to age-wise bucketing of the corresponding asset. Since, this is a technical matter based on probable outcome of default, we considered this as a Key Audit Matter.Our audit approach consisted testing of the design implementation and operating effectiveness of the internal controls and substantive testing as follows:\n\u2022 In respect of loans granted under PMUY, the \nCorporation along with other few industry peers have derived a common methodology for calculating ECL, based on the broad category of active and inactive consumers and last refill date with expected loan recovery period. We checked the working of the same and it is in line with the common methodology document shared with us.\n\u2022 We have evaluated the methodology for age-wise bucketing of trade receivables and key assumptions underlying the probability of default estimates on the same, to ascertain that the same were broadly in-line with the Corporation\u2019s historical default rates and have considered available information regarding the current economic scenario.\n\u2022 We selected a few sample outstanding receivable cases having different overdue periods and checked that the computation of ECL has been appropriately carried out in line with the Corporation\u2019s policy."

Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote. In view of significant management estimate and judgement involved, we considered this as a Key Audit Matter.The following audit procedures were carried out in this regard:\n\u2022 We examined sample items above the threshold \nlimit for determination of contingent liabilities and obtained details of completed Excise, VAT/ Sales Tax/ Entry Tax assessments, demands as well as other disputed claims against the Corporation as on March 31, 2023. The Corporation has obtained opinion from tax consultants in various disputed matters. We have relied upon such opinions and litigation history where the Corporation has concluded that possibility of cash outflow is remote while preparing its Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.\n\u2022 We have assessed the Management\u2019s underlying assumptions in estimating the possible outcome of such disputed claims/ cases against the Corporation, based on records and judicial precedents made available.\n4. Inventorie s:\nVerification and valuation of Inventories and related write down, if any, is a significant area requiring Management\u2019s judgment of estimates and application of accounting policies that have significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements. Accordingly, we considered this as a Key Audit Matter.Our audit approach involved the following combination of test of control design, implementations, operating effectiveness and substantive testing in respect of verification and valuation of inventories:\n\u2022 We evaluated the system of inventory monitoring \nand control. It was observed that inventory has been physically verified by the Management during the year at reasonable intervals.\n\u2022 Our audit teams have also physically verified on sample basis the Inventories at various locations and compliance with cut off procedures. However, since physical verification at certain locations was not possible for us, in such cases we have relied on the physical verification of inventory carried out by the Management.\n\u2022 In respect of inventory lying with third parties, we have ascertained that these have substantially been confirmed by them. We also examined the system of records maintenance for stocks lying at third party locations.\n\u2022 We have also tested the values considered in respect of Net realisable value, cost of products and verified these on sample basis with the inventory valuation and accounting entries posted in this regard."

Information Technolog y: \nA significant part of the Corporation\u2019s financial \nreporting process is heavily reliant on IT systems with automated processes and controls over the capture, storage and extraction of information. A fundamental component of these processes and controls is ensuring appropriate user access and change management protocols exist and being adhered to.\nThese protocols are important because they \nensure that access and changes to IT systems and related data are made and authorized in an appropriate manner. As our audit sought to place a high level of reliance on IT systems and application controls related to financial reporting, high proportion of the overall audit effort was in Information Technology (IT) Systems and Controls.\nWe focused our audit on those IT systems and \ncontrols that are significant to the Corporation\u2019s financial reporting process.\nAccordingly, we considered this as a Key Audit \nMatter.Our procedures included:\nWe focused our audit on those IT systems and controls \nthat are relevant to preparation of financial statements for financial year ended 31\nst March 23.\nAs audit procedures over IT Systems and controls require specific expertise, we involved our IT specialist.\nOur review of the IT Controls covers the following areas:\u2022 Physical and Logical Security;\n\u2022 Change Management;\n\u2022 Backup, Business Continuity and\n\u2022 IT Operations.\nOur assessment of the IT Controls is performed according \nto the following approach:\n\u2022 Understanding the IT environment.\n\u2022 Information gathering about the control framework \nsurrounding the IT environment.\n\u2022 Evidence gathering with respect to Control testing.\n\u2022 Review of Implementation of controls testing.\n\u2022 Review of limited cases to identify whether there \nhad been unauthorized or inappropriate access or changes made to critical IT systems and related data.\nInformation Other than the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements and Auditors\u2019 Report Thereon\n5.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Corporation and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n9. In preparing the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Corporation\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Corporation or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n10. The Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors / Management is responsible for overseeing the Corporation\u2019s financial reporting process.\nAuditors\u2019 Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements\n11. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements \nas a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.\n12. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n \u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n \u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Corporation has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. \n \u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management."

All figures appearing in the Financial Statements are rounded to the nearest Crores ( ` Crores) except where otherwise indicated.\n1.2. Use of Judgement and Estimates\n The preparation of the Corporation\u2019s Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and the accompanying disclosures along with contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require material adjustments to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. The Corporation continually evaluates these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information.\n In particular, information about significant areas of estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Financial Statements are as below:\n \u2022 Assessment of functional currency;\n \u2022 Financial instruments;\n \u2022 Estimates of useful lives and residual value of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible assets;\n \u2022 Valuation of Inventories;\n \u2022 Measurement of recoverable amounts of Cash-Generating Units;\n \u2022 Measurement of Defined Benefit Obligations and actuarial assumptions;\n \u2022 Provisions including loss allowances;\n \u2022 Evaluation of recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets; and\n \u2022 Contingencies."

As a Lessee\n  At the commencement date, corporation recognizes a right-of-use asset at cost and a lease liability at present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement date. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Corporation assesses whether: \n  - the contract involves the use of an identified asset;\n  - the Corporation has right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and; \n  - the Corporation has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n  The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability (at present value) adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives (at present value) except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Corporation recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense. Lease of items such as IT Assets (tablets, personal computers, mobiles, POS machines etc.), small items of office furniture etc. are treated as low value. \n  The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the Corporation\u2019s incremental borrowing rate computed on periodic basis based on lease term. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Corporation changes its assessment, whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. \n  Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on systematic basis and Interest on lease liability is charged to Statement of Profit and Loss as Finance cost.\n  The Corporation has elected not to apply Ind AS 116 \u201cLeases\u201d to Intangible assets. \n 1.9.2. As a Lessor\n A lessor shall classify each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease.\n 1.9.2.1. Finance leases\n  A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.\n  Corporation shall recognize assets held under a finance lease in its balance sheet and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.\n 1.9.2.2. Operating leases\n  A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.\n  Corporation shall recognize lease payments from operating leases as income on systematic basis in the pattern in which benefit from the use of the underlying asset is diminished."

Non-financial assets other than inventories, deferred tax assets and non-current assets classified as \nheld for sale are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Corporation estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset\u2019s or Cash-Generating Unit\u2019s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.\n 1.10.2. The carrying amount of Goodwill arising from business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n 1.10.3. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n1.11. Inventories \n 1.11.1.

Customs duty on Raw materials/Finished goods lying in bonded warehouse are provided for at the applicable rates except where liability to pay duty is transferred to consignee. \n 1.11.3. Excise duty on finished stocks lying at manufacturing locations is provided for at the assessable value applicable at each of the locations based on end use. \n 1.11.4. The net realizable value of finished goods and stock in trade are based on the inter-company transfer prices and final selling prices (applicable at the location of stock) for sale to oil marketing companies and retail consumers respectively. For the purpose of stock valuation, the proportion of sales to oil marketing companies and retail consumers are determined on all India basis and considered for stock valuation at all locations. \n 1.11.5. Raw Materials held for use in the production of finished goods are not written down below cost except in cases where raw material prices have declined and it is estimated that the cost of the finished goods will exceed their net realizable value.\n 1.11.6. Obsolete, slow moving, surplus and defective stocks are identified at the time of physical verification of stocks and where necessary, provision is made for such stocks.\n1.12. Revenue Recognition\n 1.12.1. Sale of goods\n  Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the related goods to the customer. The performance obligation is considered to be satisfied when the customer obtains control of the goods. \n  Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the transaction price received or receivable (after including transaction price allocations related to arrangements involving more than one performance obligation), net of returns, taxes or duties collected on behalf of the Government and applicable trade discounts or rebates.\n  Revenue is allocated between loyalty programmes and other components of the sale. The amount allocated to the loyalty programme is deferred, and is recognized as revenue when the Corporation"

Contingent liabilities and Capital Commitments disclosed are in respect of items which in each case \nare above the threshold limit.\n1.19. Fair Value measurement\n 1.19.1. The Corporation measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each reporting date.\n 1.19.2. Certain accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. \n 1.19.3. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Corporation has access at that date. The fair value of a liability also reflects its non-performance risk. \n 1.19.4. The best estimate of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price - i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Corporation determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently that difference is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. \n 1.19.5. While measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Corporation uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation technique as follows: \n  - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n  - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) \n  - Level 3: inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) \n 1.19.6. When quoted price in active market for an instrument is available, the Corporation measures the fair value of the instrument using that price. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. \n 1.19.7. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Corporation uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. \n 1.19.8. The Corporation regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If the third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the Corporation assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. \n1.20.

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n  If there is revision in estimates of receipts/contractual cash flows, gross carrying amount of the financial assets are recalculated at period end as the present value of the estimated future contractual \ncash flows that are discounted at the financial asset\u2019s original effective interest rate due to revision in \nestimates of receipts. Adjustment, if any, is recognised as income or expense in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  Debt instruments at Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)\n  A \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the fair value through Other Comprehensive Income if both the \nfollowing conditions are met:\n  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both\n  - collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and\n  - contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding.\n  After initial measurement, these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income under Effective Interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. \n  Debt instruments at Fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \n  Fair Value through Profit or Loss is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, \nwhich does not meet the criteria for categorization at amortized cost or as FVOCI, is classified as FVTPL.\n  After initial measurement, any fair value changes including any interest income, foreign exchange gain and losses, impairment losses and other net gains and losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss separately.\n  Equity investments \n  All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Such equity \ninstruments which are held for trading are classified as FVTPL. For all other such equity instruments, the Corporation decides to classify the same either as FVOCI or FVTPL.

De-recognition \n  A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e. removed from the Corporation\u2019s Balance Sheet) when:\n  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or \n  The Corporation has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass-through\u2019 arrangement; and either:\n  - The Corporation has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or \n  - The Corporation has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n  On de-recognition, any gains or losses on all debt instruments (other than debt instruments measured at FVOCI) and equity instruments (measured at FVTPL) are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

The amortization done using the EIR method is included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n 1.21.3. De-recognition \n  A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n1.22. Financial guarantees\n Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Corporation are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as \nper impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the fair value initially recognized less cumulative amortization. \n1.23. Derivative financial instruments \n The Corporation uses derivative financial instruments to manage the commodity price risk and exposure on \naccount of fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value with the changes being recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n The fair valuation gains or losses on foreign currency derivatives measured at FVTPL are grouped along with Gain or loss on foreign currency transactions and translations and presented under \u201cOther Income\u201d or \u201cOther expenses\u201d, as the case may be, since these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective and may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109.\n1.24. Embedded derivatives \n If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset within the scope of Ind AS 109, the classification requirements contained in Ind AS 109 are applied to the entire hybrid contract. Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts, including financial liabilities are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not held for trading or designated at fair value through profit and loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss, unless designated as effective hedging instruments. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. \n1.25. Offsetting of financial instruments \n Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously."

Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n  Deferred Tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in the Statement of Profit and Loss, Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity. \n  Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n1.27. Earnings per share\n 1.27.1. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividends, if any, and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.\n 1.27.2. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n1.28. Classification of Assets and Liabilities as Current and Non-Current:\n All assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current as per the Corporation\u2019s normal operating cycle (considered as 12 months) and other criteria set out in Schedule III of the Act.\n1.29. Cash and Cash equivalents\n Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet include cash at bank, cash, cheque, draft on hand and demand deposits with an original maturity of less than three months, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. \n For the purpose of Statement of Cash Flows, Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, cash, cheques and drafts on hand, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Corporation\u2019s cash management.

Cash Flows\n Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are segregated. \n1.31. Business Combinations of entities under common control \n Business combinations involving entities that are ultimately controlled by the same party(ies) before and after the business combination are considered as common control entities and are accounted using the pooling of interest method as follows:\n - The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts. \n - No adjustments are made to reflect the fair values, or recognise new assets or liabilities. Adjustments are made to harmonise accounting policies.\n - The financial information in the Financial Statements in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business combination has occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the Financial Statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. However, if business combination had occurred after that date, the prior period information shall be restated only from that date.\n The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the Financial Statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the Financial Statements of the transferee or is adjusted against general reserve.\n The identity of the reserves are preserved and the reserves of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee.\n The difference if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.\n1.32.

As a recognition of contribution of employees in growth of the Corporation and increase in shareholders\u2019 value, the Scheme as a primary objective seeks to reward eligible employees for their loyalty/longevity with the Corporation. The Scheme also covered the employees who had opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) during FY 2020-21.\n As per Vesting Condition of the Scheme, the employee had to render services till the date of share transfer or retirement (including VRS) or Death in Service whichever is earlier. In view of the above, the Scheme was accounted as Employee Stock Option Scheme, in line with the applicable Ind AS. \n Each option converted into one equity share of the Corporation upon exercise. No amounts were paid or payable by the recipient on receipt of the option. The options carried neither rights to dividends nor voting rights. These options were vested and exercised on 20\nth April 2021. All options which remained unexercised \nduring FY 2021-22 have lapsed.\n The share-based payments (options) to employees being equity-settled instruments were measured at the fair value of the equity instruments of the Corporation at the grant date. The fair value determined at the grant \ndate of the equity-settled share-based payments was expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, \nbased on the Corporation\u2019s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in Total Equity."

The Corporation takes into consideration external and internal sources of information available about the asset to check whether any indication for impairment exists. If any such indication exists, the Corporation estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. The value in use is assessed based on the estimated future cash flows which are discounted to their present value using the discount rate that reflects the time value of money and risk specific to the assets for which the future cash flows estimates have not been adjusted. An impairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent asset\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.\nBased on the assessment, there is no indication of impairment of assets except for the Corporation\u2019s investment in \nsubsidiary company Bharat PetroResources Limited (BPRL). The gross carrying value of investment in BPRL as of 31\nst March 2023 is  ` 9,601.37 Crores. BPRL is an upstream company and is having investments in Oil and Gas Blocks \nglobally and in India, either directly or through its Subsidiaries (including step down Subsidiaries), Joint ventures and Associates. During the current financial year, BPRL has impaired investments in its subsidiary company due to change in prospects of its blocks. Accordingly, impairment testing was carried out on equity investment made by the Corporation in BPRL and an impairment loss of ` 1,359.96 Crores has been recognized based on the value in \nuse of assets as on 31\nst March 2023. Such impairment loss is shown as an exceptional item in Statement of Profit \nand Loss for the year ended 31st March 2023. The accumulated impairment loss on investments in BPRL as of 31st \nMarch 2023 is ` 3,392.75 Crores.\nDuring the previous year, an impairment provision of `14.08 Crores was created on investment in one of the \nassociate companies [GSPL India Transco Limited], which is shown under other expenses."

Credit risk ;   \nii. Liquidity risk ; and   \niii. Market risk\nC.ii. Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Corporation if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group\u2019s trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances, derivatives and debt securities. The maximum exposure to credit risk in case of all the financial instruments covered below is restricted to their respective carrying amount.\n(a) Trade and other receivables from customers\n Credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit \nlimits and monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to whom the Corporation grants credit terms in the normal course of business.\n As at 31\nst March 2023 and 31st March 2022, the Corporation\u2019s retail dealers, industrial and aviation customers \naccounted for the majority of the trade receivables.\n Expected credit loss assessment for Trade and other receivables from customers as at 31st March 2023 and 31st  March 2022\n The Corporation uses an allowance matrix to measure the expected credit losses of trade and other receivables.  \nThe loss rates are computed using a \u2018Roll Rate\u2019 method based on the probability of receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write off. Roll rates are calculated separately for exposures in different segments based on the following common credit risk characteristics - type of product purchases, type of customers."

This project is being partly funded through project finance under which an amount of USD 15.4 Billion has already been finalised. BPCL has provided a Debt Service Undertaking (DSU) to guarantee its pro rata share (i.e. towards BPRL Venture Mozambique BV\u2019s Participating Interest (PI) of 10% in the project) of project finance obligations to any project finance beneficiaries under project financing arrangement, capped at a maximum of USD 1.92 Billion (out of which the draw down was USD 28.73 Million as at 31\nst March 2023) (Draw down was USD 28.73 Million as at 31st March 2022). \nThese guarantee amounts will be payable on default by the concerned entity.

Market risk\nMarket Risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of \nchanges in market prices. Market risk comprises four types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity risk and other price risk.\nC.iv.a Currency risk\nThe Corporation is exposed to currency risk on account of its operating and financing activities. The functional \ncurrency of the Corporation is Indian Rupee. Our exposure is mainly denominated in US Dollars (USD). The USD exchange rate has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.  \nThe Corporation has put in place a Financial Risk Management Policy to identify the most effective and efficient ways of managing the currency risks. The Corporation uses derivative instruments, (mainly foreign exchange forward contracts) to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in line with the policy.\nThe Corporation does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nExposure to currency risk\nThe currency profile in INR of foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31\nst March \n2023 and  31st March 2022 are as below:"

Ltd., FINO Paytech Limited and BPCL-KIAL Fuel Farm Private Limited are yet to be audited and hence provisional Financial Statements provided by management of the respective companies have been considered for the purpose of preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements. \n1.2. Basis of consolidatio n \n 1.2.1. subsidiaries\n  Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Corporation. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those which significantly affect the entity\u2019s returns. The Financial Statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which the control ceases.\n  Subsidiaries are consolidated by combining like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. The intra-company balances and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These consolidated Financial Statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Corporation. Non-controlling interests (\u201cNCI\u201d) which represent part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the company, are excluded.\n  Changes in the Corporation\u2019s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n 1.2.2. Joint Venture and associates\n  A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Corporation has joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than the rights to its assets and obligation for its liabilities. An associate is an entity in which the Corporation has significant influence, but no control or joint control over the financial and operating policies.\n  Interest in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognized at cost which includes transaction cost. Subsequent to initial recognition the consolidated Financial Statements include the JVCs and associates share of profit or loss and Other Comprehensive Income (\u201cOCI\u201d) of such entities until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.\n  Unrealised gains / losses arising from transactions with such entities are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Corporation\u2019s interest in the investee.\n 1.2.3.

Pursuant to this exemption, goodwill / \ncapital reserve arising from business combination has been stated at the carrying amount under Previous GAAP. In accordance with Ind AS 103, the Group accounts for these business combinations using the acquisition method when the control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred for the business combinations is generally measured at fair value as at the date the control is acquired (acquisition date), of the net identifiable assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. \n  If a business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in Profit or Loss or OCI as appropriate.\n  Common Control \n  Business combinations involving entities that are ultimately controlled by the same party(ies) before and after the business combination are considered as Common control entities and are accounted using the pooling of interest method as follows:\n  -  The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts.\n  - No adjustments are made to reflect the fair values, or recognise new assets or liabilities. Adjustments are made to harmonise accounting policies.\n  - The financial information in the Financial Statements in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business combination has occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the Financial Statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. However, if business combination had occurred after that date, the prior period information shall be restated only from that date.\n  The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the Financial Statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the Financial Statements of the transferee or is adjusted against general reserve.\n  The identity of the reserves are preserved and the reserves of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee.\n  The difference if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.\n1.3. Use of Judgements and e stimates\n The preparation of the consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and the accompanying disclosures along with contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require material adjustments to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. The Group continually evaluates these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information.\n In particular, information about significant areas of estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated Financial Statements are as below:\n \u2022 Assessment of functional currency;\n \u2022 Financial instruments;\n \u2022 Estimates of useful lives and residual value of Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets;\n \u2022 Valuation of inventories;\n \u2022 Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;"

Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact the determination of the Group\u2019s estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. The Group estimates its proved reserves with a reasonable certainty on the basis of rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n - Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization charges for the Group\u2019s oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the consolidated financial statements. If proved reserves estimates are revised downwards, retained earnings could be affected by changes in depreciation expense or an immediate write-down of the property\u2019s carrying value.\n Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized prospectively in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n1.4. Property, plant and equipment \n 1.4.1. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. \n 1.4.2. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost (including import duties and non-refundable taxes), any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if any, and, borrowing cost for qualifying assets (i.e. assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use).\n 1.4.3. Direct expenses incurred during construction period on capital projects are capitalized. Other expenses of the project group which are allocated to projects costing above the threshold limits are also capitalized. Expenditure incurred on enabling assets are capitalised. \n 1.4.4. Gas distribution systems is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment when it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. \n 1.4.5. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the group.\n 1.4.6. Expenditure on assets, other than plant and machinery, LPG cylinders and pressure regulators, not exceeding the threshold limits are charged to revenue.\n 1.4.7. Spare parts which meet the definition of Property, Plant and Equipment are capitalized as Property, Plant and Equipment in case the unit value of the spare part is above the threshold limits. In other cases, the spare part is inventorized on procurement and charged to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on consumption."

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Group has right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n  The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability (at present value) adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives (at present value) except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense. Lease of items such as IT Assets (tablets, personal computers, mobiles, POS machines etc.), small items of office furniture etc. are treated as low value. \n  The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments.

Impairment of Non-financial Assets\n 1.11.1. Non-financial assets other than inventories, deferred tax assets and non-current assets classified as held for sale are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset\u2019s or Cash-Generating Units\u2019 (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets."

Post-employment benefits\n  Defined Contribution Plans: \n  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans such as pension are recognized as an \nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a set-off in future payments is available.\n  Defined Benefit Plans: \n  The net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans such as gratuity, other post-employment benefits etc., is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that the employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. \n  The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed at each reporting period end by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the entity, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n  The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as part of employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.

Foreign Currency transactions \n 1.16.1. Monetary items:\n  Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at their respective exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. \n  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.\n  Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items (except for long term foreign currency monetary items outstanding as of 31\nst March 2016) are recognized in Consolidated \nStatement of Profit and Loss either as profit or loss on foreign currency transaction and translation or as borrowing costs to the extent regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs. \n  The Group has elected to continue the policy adopted under Previous GAAP for accounting the foreign exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding as of 31\nst March 2016 i.e. foreign exchange differences arising on settlement or translation \nof long-term foreign currency monetary items relating to acquisition of depreciable assets are adjusted to the carrying cost of the assets and depreciated over the balance life of the asset and in other cases, if any, accumulated in \u201cForeign Currency Monetary Item Translation Difference Account\u201d and amortized over the balance period of the liability.\n 1.16.2. non - Monetary items:\n  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.\n 1.16.3. In case of group companies of BPRL, the results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n  Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet.\n  Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and\n  All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n  Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n1.17. Government Grants\n 1.17.1. Government grants are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. \n 1.17.2.

Provisions, Contingent l iabilities and Capital Commitments \n 1.18.1. Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n 1.18.2. The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss net of reimbursements, if any.\n 1.18.3. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n 1.18.4. Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the Group, or present obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. \n 1.18.5. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the Financial Statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.\n 1.18.6. Contingent liabilities and Capital Commitments disclosed are in respect of items which in each case are above the threshold limits.\n1.19. Fair Value measurement\n 1.19.1. The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each reporting date.\n 1.19.2. Certain accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non- financial assets and liabilities. \n 1.19.3. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability also reflects its non-performance risk. \n 1.19.4. The best estimate of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determine that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently that difference is recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. \n 1.19.5. While measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation technique as follows: \n  - level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n  - level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) \n  - level 3:  inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)"

When quoted price in active market for an instrument is available, the Group measure the fair value of \nthe instrument using that price. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. \n 1.19.7. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses a valuation technique that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. \n 1.19.8. The Group regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If the third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then they assess the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. \n1.20. Financial assets \n 1.20.1. initial recognition and measurement \n  Trade Receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant \nfinancing component are measured at transaction price.\n 1.20.2. subsequent measurement \n  Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial \nassets. Based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset, the Group classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit and loss. \n  debt instruments at amortized cost \n  A \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is \n  - To hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and \n  - Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n  After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. \n  If there is revision in estimates of receipts/contractual cash flows, gross carrying amount of the financial assets are recalculated at period end as the present value of the estimated future contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset\u2019s original effective interest rate due to revision in estimates of receipts. Adjustment, if any, is recognised as income or expense in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  debt instruments at Fair value through other Comprehensive income (FVoCi)\n  A \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the fair value through Other Comprehensive Income if both the following conditions are met:"

Interest income under effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive Income. \n  Debt instruments at Fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \n  Fair Value through Profit or Loss is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation at amortized cost or as FVOCI, is classified as FVTPL.\n  After initial measurement, any fair value changes including any interest income, foreign exchange gain and losses, impairment losses and other net gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss separately.\n  equity investments \n  All equity investments within the scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Such equity instruments \nwhich are held for trading are classified as FVTPL. For all other such equity instruments, the Group decides to classify the same either as FVOCI or FVTPL. They make such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. \n  For equity instruments classified as FVOCI, all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Dividends on such equity instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n  Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n 1.20.3. de-recognition \n  A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e. removed from the entity\u2019s Balance Sheet) when\n  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or \n  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset is transferred or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass-through\u2019 arrangement; and either:\n  - The risks and rewards of the asset has been transferred substantially, or \n  - The risk and rewards of the asset are neither transferred nor retained, but the control of the asset is transferred.\n  On de-recognition, any gains or losses on all debt instruments (other than debt instruments measured \nat FVOCI) and equity instruments (measured at FVTPL) are recognized in the Consolidated Statement \nof Profit and Loss. Gains and losses in respect of debt instruments measured at FVOCI and that are accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss on de-recognition. Gains or losses on equity instruments measured at FVOCI that are recognized and accumulated in OCI are not reclassified to profit or loss on de-recognition. \n 1.20.4. Impairment of financial assets \n  In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies Expected Credit Loss (\u201cECL\u201d) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the financial assets measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at FVOCI."

Financial liabilities\n 1.21.1. initial recognition and measurement\n  Financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n  Financial liability is initially measured at fair value minus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.\n 1.21.2. subsequent measurement \n  Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial liabilities. \n  Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \n  A financial liability is classified as at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) if it is classified as held-for-trading or is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest expense, are recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. \n  Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n  After initial recognition, financial liabilities other than those which are classified as FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (\u201cEIR\u201d) method. \n  Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortization done using the EIR method is included as finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. \n 1.21.3. de-recognition \n  A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n1.22. Financial guarantees\n Financial guarantee contracts are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms \nof the debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted \nfor transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the fair value initially recognized less cumulative amortization. \n1.23. Derivative financial instruments \n The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the commodity price risk and exposure on account of fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rates.

The UOP rate for computing depreciation charge for the acquisition cost within a field is arrived at by dividing the acquisition cost of the field by the Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and for all other capitalised costs, by dividing the depreciation base of the cost centre by the Proved Developed Oil and Gas Reserves. The depreciation base of a cost centre includes the gross block of the cost centre and estimated site restoration expenditure and is reduced by the accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment charge of the cost centre.

BPRL follows the accounting policy as explained below for its oil and natural gas exploration and \nproduction activities. \n  i. Acquisition costs such as costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property or mineral right proved or unproved are capitalised. Any pre-acquisition costs are expensed as and when incurred.\n  ii. All costs which are directly attributable to the exploration and evaluation activities of oil and gas are capitalised as Exploratory Wells-in-Progress under \u201cintangible assets under development\u201d. General and administrative costs are included in the exploration and evaluation cost only to the extent that those costs can be directly attributable to the related exploration and evaluation assets. In all other cases, these costs are expensed as incurred.\n  iii. BPRL classifies the acquisition costs, exploration and evaluation assets as tangible asset or intangible asset according to the nature of assets acquired. \n  iv. Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting oil and gas are determinable, exploration and evaluation assets are classified as Development Wells-in-Progress under \u201cintangible assets under development\u201d. Exploration and evaluation asset is assessed for impairment, and impairment loss if any, is recognized, before such reclassification. Subsequent development costs including costs incurred for production facilities are capitalised as and when incurred as intangible assets under development or intangible assets as the case may be.\n  v. When a well within a block or cost centre is ready to commence commercial production, the capitalised costs referred above are reclassified as intangible assets. The cost centre is not normally smaller than a country, except, where warranted by a major difference in economic, fiscal or other factors in the country.\n  vi. When a block or cost centre is relinquished, the accumulated cost is charged off as an expense in the said year.\n  vii.  BPRL capitalises the obligations for removal and restoration that are incurred during a particular period as a consequence of having undertaken the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources and the amount of provision required to be created for subsequent abandonment as part of Property, Plant and Equipment or Intangible Assets, as the case may be. The provision for estimated abandonment costs is made at current prices considering the environment and social obligations, terms of mining lease agreement, industry practice, etc. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate (or rates) is pre-tax rate (or rates) that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where there is an uncertainty of timing on the incurrence of the expenditure, time value of money is not considered while providing for the obligations. Changes in the measurement of existing abandonment costs that result from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation or a change in the discount rate is added to, or deducted from the related field in the current period and is considered for necessary depletion (depreciation) prospectively. The change in the estimated provision due to the periodic unwinding of the discount is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as it occurs."

Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount.

In view of the above, the Scheme was accounted as Employee Stock Option Scheme, in line with the applicable Ind AS.\n Each option converted into one equity share of the Corporation upon exercise. No amounts were paid or payable by the recipient on receipt of the option. The options carried neither rights to dividends nor voting rights.
